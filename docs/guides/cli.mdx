<Warning>Continue CLI (cn) is currently in Alpha</Warning>

`cn` is an open-source, modular coding agent for the command line.

It provides a battle-tested agent loop so you can simply plug in your model, rules, and tools.

## How to Get Started with Continue CLI

<Info>
  Make sure you have [Node.js 18 or higher
  installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
</Info>

```bash
# Install
npm i -g @continuedev/cli

# Interactive mode
cn

# Headless mode
cn -p "Generate a conventional commit name for the current git changes"
```

## How to Use Continue CLI - Basic Usage

Out of the box, `cn` comes with tools that let it understand your codebase, edit files, run terminal commands, and more (if you approve). You can ask `cn` to:

- Fix failing tests
- Find something in the codebase
- Execute a refactor
- Write a new feature
- And a lot more

Use '@' to give it file context, or '/' to run slash commands.

If you want to resume a previous conversation, run `cn --resume`.

## How to Use Headless Mode (`-p` flag)

In headless mode, `cn` will only output its final response, making it perfect for Unix Philosophy-style scripting and automation. For example, you could pipe your git diff into `cn` to generate a commit message, and write this to a file:

```bash
echo "$(git diff) Generate a conventional commit name for the current git changes" | cn -p > commit-message.txt
```

## How to Configure Continue CLI

Continue CLI uses the same configuration format as the Continue VS Code extension. This means your existing Continue configuration will work with `cn`.

### How to Configure Models

Learn how to add custom models [here](./customization/models.mdx). Then, you can use the `/model` slash command to switch between them in `cn`.

### How to Configure Rules

`cn` supports [rules](./customize/deep-dives/rules.mdx) in the same way as the Continue IDE extensions. You can also use the `--rule` flag to manually include a rule from the hub. For example, `cn --rule nate/spanish` will tell `cn` to use [this rule](https://hub.continue.dev/nate/spanish) to always speak in Spanish.

### How to Configure Tools

`cn` supports MCP tools, which can be configured in the [same way](./customize/deep-dives/mcp.mdx) as with the Continue IDE extensions.

#### How to Set Tool Permissions

`cn` includes a tool permission system to make sure you approve of the agent's actions. It will begin with minimal permissions but as you approve tool calls, it will add policies to `~/.continue/permissions.yaml` to remember your preferences.

If you want to explicitly allow or deny tools for a single session, you can use the command line flags `--allow`, `--ask`, and `--exclude`. For example:

```bash
# Always allow the Write tool
cn --allow Write()

# Always ask before running curl
cn --ask Bash(curl*)

# Never use the Fetch tool
cn --exclude Fetch
```

## How to Troubleshoot Continue CLI

Run `cn` with the `--verbose` flag to see more detailed logs. These will be output to `~/.continue/logs/cn.log`.
