## Performance Optimization Steps

### Step 1: Baseline Performance Metrics

Establish your current performance baseline using cn CLI:

```bash
# Start cn in TUI mode
cn

# Then ask:
"Show my site's Core Web Vitals and build times"
```

<Tip>
  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before making performance optimizations that
  might affect your site, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode
  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes). This
  shows you what the agent will do without executing it. For example: `"Set up
  A/B testing between main and feature branch with performance monitoring"`
</Tip>

<Info>

    Netlify automatically tracks: 
    - **Build Performance**: Compile times, cache
    hits 
    - **Runtime Performance**: Core Web Vitals, Time to Interactive 
    -  **Resource Usage**: Bandwidth, function execution times
    
</Info>

### Step 2: A/B Test Branch Performance

Compare performance between branches:

```bash
# In cn TUI mode:
"Set up A/B test between main and feature branch on Netlify:
- Split traffic 50/50 between branches
- Track Core Web Vitals for each variant
- Monitor conversion metrics and bounce rate
- Enable analytics to measure performance impact
- Configure cookie-based visitor persistence
- Set test duration for 1000 unique visitors
- Auto-conclude test when statistical significance reached
Report winner based on performance + conversion metrics"
```

<Info>
  **Enhanced Analytics**: Combine Netlify's A/B testing with PostHog session
  recordings to understand not just which variant performs better, but why users
  behave differently. See our [PostHog session analysis
  guide](/guides/posthog-github-continuous-ai) to set up session tracking and
  create a complete continuous AI analytics workflow.
</Info>

### Step 3: Advanced Build Optimization with Netlify

Leverage Netlify's powerful build features to dramatically reduce build times:

```bash
# In cn TUI mode:
"Optimize my Netlify build performance using these features:

1. Enable Netlify Cache Plugin for dependency caching
   - Configure @netlify/plugin-cache for node_modules
   - Set up custom cache directories for .next/cache or .nuxt
   - Enable Gatsby's incremental builds if applicable

2. Set up Build Plugins from Netlify's ecosystem:
   - Install @netlify/plugin-lighthouse for performance monitoring
   - Add netlify-plugin-checklinks to prevent broken links
   - Configure netlify-plugin-submit-sitemap for SEO

3. Implement Conditional Builds:
   - Skip builds when only docs change (ignore: /docs/**)
   - Use build.ignore script for custom logic
   - Set up monorepo-specific build triggers

4. Configure concurrent builds for monorepos
   - Set base directory per package
   - Use pnpm workspaces or yarn workspaces

Show me the netlify.toml configuration and explain each optimization"
```

<Info>
  **Netlify Build Features You're Getting**:
  - [Build Caching](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-caching/) - Persist dependencies between builds
  - [Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/build-plugins/) - Extend build process with 100+ plugins
  - [Conditional Builds](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/ignore-builds/) - Skip unnecessary builds
  - [Monorepo Support](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/monorepos/) - Optimize multi-package repos

These features can reduce build times by 50-70% for most projects!

</Info>

<Tip>
  **Discover more optimization prompts!** The Netlify community has documented dozens of build optimization strategies in their [Support Guide: How can I optimize my Netlify build time](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-how-can-i-optimize-my-netlify-build-time/3907). 
  
  Use this guide as inspiration for cn CLI prompts not covered in this cookbook, such as:
  - `"Configure my builds to skip Dependabot PRs automatically"`
  - `"Set up custom ignore patterns for documentation-only changes"`
  - `"Optimize my Contentful webhooks to prevent duplicate builds"`
  - `"Show me how to use build hooks instead of automatic git triggers"`
  - `"Help me choose between Astro and Hugo based on build performance"`
  
  The community guide contains real-world scenarios that you can turn into AI-assisted solutions - just describe what you want to achieve and let cn CLI handle the implementation!
</Tip>

### Step 4: Bundle Analysis with Netlify's Built-in Tools

Use Netlify's bundle analyzer and optimization features:

```bash
# In cn TUI mode:
"Analyze and optimize my bundle using Netlify's tools:

```

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

### Step 6: Performance Budget Enforcement with Lighthouse CI

Set and enforce performance budgets with automated testing:

```bash
# In cn TUI mode:
"Set up Lighthouse CI with performance budgets for my Netlify site:

Requirements:
- LCP must be < 2.5 seconds
- JavaScript bundle must be < 200KB
- Total size < 500KB
- Performance score >= 90

Setup needed:
1. Install @lhci/cli and @netlify/plugin-lighthouse
2. Create lighthouserc.js with these budget assertions
3. Configure netlify.toml to run checks on all deploys
4. Add GitHub status checks to block PRs that exceed budgets
5. Create performance dashboard at /lighthouse-reports

Please configure the complete Lighthouse CI setup with these budgets."
```

<Tip>
  This comprehensive setup will automatically test every deploy preview and
  production deployment, blocking any changes that violate your performance
  budgets.
</Tip>

### Step 7: Real User Monitoring with Netlify Analytics

Leverage Netlify's built-in analytics and integrate advanced RUM solutions:

```bash
# In cn TUI mode:
