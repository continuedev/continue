## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- Operating System: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- RAM: Minimum 8GB (16GB+ recommended)
- Storage: At least 10GB free space
- Continue extension installed

## Installation Steps

brew install ollama

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Windows
# Download from ollama.ai
```

### Step 2: Download Models

After installing Ollama, download the models you want to use. Here are some popular options:

```
# Popular models for development
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

## Configuration

Configure Continue to work with your local Ollama instance:

### Continue Configuration

```yaml
models:
  - name: mistral
    provider: ollama
    apiBase: http://localhost:11434
    model: mistral
    roles:
      - chat
      - edit
      - apply
  - name: Qwen2.5-Coder 1.5B
    provider: ollama
    apiBase: http://localhost:11434
    model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base
    roles:
      - autocomplete
  - name: Nomic Embed
    provider: ollama
    apiBase: http://localhost:11434
    model: nomic-embed-text:latest
    roles:
      - embed
```

You can update `apiBase` with the IP address of a remote machine serving Ollama. 

### Advanced Settings
