<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="notion">

  A workflow that lets you query, update, and create Notion pages or database
  entries from natural-language prompts. Generate PRDs, sprint tasks, meeting
  notes, or status reports automatically – perfect for individual developers
  and cross-functional teams.

</Card>

## What You'll Learn

- Connect the [Notion MCP](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp/) to Continue
- Securely add both Notion and Continue API keys as Hub secrets
- Use a pre-built agent (`continuedev/notion-continuous-ai`) for instant productivity
- Issue advanced prompts to automate docs, tasks, and reporting

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Continue CLI](/guides/cli) installed (`npm i -g @continuedev/cli`)
- A [Notion workspace](https://notion.so) with Editor (or higher) access
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue account](https://hub.continue.dev) with **Hub access**

<Warning>

  **Agent usage requires credits** – create a Continue API key at
  [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
  and store it as a secret.

</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    cn --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Notion Integration & Get Token">
    1. Go to **[Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)**
    2. Click **+ New integration** → give it a name (e.g. "Continue MCP")
    3. Select your workspace
    4. Under **Capabilities** enable **Read** / **Write**
    5. Click **Submit** and Copy the **Internal Integration Token**

    <Info>

      This token is your `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` secret.
      Keep it safe – you won't be able to view it again.

    </Info>

    6. In Notion, open each database or top-level page you want accessible → **Share** → **Invite** your new integration → **Full access**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secrets to Continue Hub">
    1. Open **[Continue Hub Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)**
    2. Click **+ New Secret** and add the following:
      - **Key:** `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` → **Value:** `secret_...` (Your token from Step 2)
      - **Key:** `CONTINUE_API_KEY` → **Value:** `cont_api_...` (Your Continue API key)

    <Tip>

      Continue's secure storage means secrets are available in any prompt as
      `$NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` etc.

    </Tip>
  </Step>

## Example Prompts & Workflows

Now you can use natural language prompts to automate Notion. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Notion MCP tools.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generate Meeting Notes" icon="users">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Summarize today's stand-up notes from Slack and create a
    new page titled "Stand-up 2024-06-20" in the Meetings database.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sync Issue Tracker" icon="list-checks">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    For all incomplete tasks in the Sprint Board database
    with status = "In Progress" older than 7 days, move
    them to status = "Blocked" and tag the owner.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Create Release Notes" icon="rocket">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Draft release notes for version 2.1 from commits since tag v2.0.
    Save as a page in the Release Notes database and @mention @marketing.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Create PRD" icon="file-plus">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Create a PRD outline for the new payment flow and save it
    to my Product Specs database.

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Tool Workflows

Combine Notion with other MCPs for powerful automation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Notion + Slack" icon="comments">
    ```
    "Check the #standup channel for today's updates,
    then create a summary page in Notion's Team Updates
    database with key blockers highlighted."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Notion + GitHub" icon="github">
    ```
    "Create a sprint retrospective page analyzing
    closed issues from the last 2 weeks, categorize
    by type, and suggest process improvements."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Notion + Linear" icon="chart-line">
    ```
    "Sync all 'In Progress' Linear issues to the
    Notion Sprint Board, updating status and assignee
    fields to match."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Notion + Analytics" icon="chart-bar">
    ```
    "Analyze this week's user metrics and create
    a product insights page with recommendations
    for the next sprint planning session."
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>

  **Protect Your API Keys:**
  - Treat `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` like a password → rotate every 90 days
  - Grant the integration only required page/database access
  - Use Continue's secrets, never commit tokens to git
  - Monitor token usage for unusual activity

</Warning>
