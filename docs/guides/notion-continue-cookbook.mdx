<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="notion">

  A workflow that lets you query, update, and create Notion pages or database
  entries from natural-language prompts. Generate PRDs, sprint tasks, meeting
  notes, or status reports automatically – perfect for individual developers
  and cross-functional teams.

</Card>

## What You'll Learn

- Connect the [Notion MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/notion/notion-mcp) to Continue
- Securely add both Notion and Continue API keys as Hub secrets
- Use a pre-built agent (`continuedev/notion-continuous-ai`) for instant productivity
- Issue advanced prompts to automate docs, tasks, and reporting

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Continue CLI](/guides/cli) installed (`npm i -g @continuedev/cli`)
- A [Notion workspace](https://notion.so) with Editor (or higher) access
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue account](https://hub.continue.dev) with **Hub access**

<Warning>

  **Agent usage requires credits** – create a Continue API key at
  [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
  and store it as a secret.

</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    cn --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Notion Integration & Get Token">
    1. Go to **[Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)**
    2. Click **+ New integration** → give it a name (e.g. "Continue MCP")
    3. Select your workspace
    4. Under **Capabilities** enable **Read** / **Write**
    5. Click **Submit** and Copy the **Internal Integration Token**

    <Info>

      This token is your `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` secret.
      Keep it safe – you won't be able to view it again.

    </Info>

    6. In Notion, open each database or top-level page you want accessible → **Share** → **Invite** your new integration → **Full access**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secrets to Continue Hub">
    1. Open **[Continue Hub Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)**
    2. Click **+ New Secret** and add the following:
      - **Key:** `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` → **Value:** `secret_...` (Your token from Step 2)
      - **Key:** `CONTINUE_API_KEY` → **Value:** `cont_api_...` (Your Continue API key)

    <Tip>

      Continue's secure storage means secrets are available in any prompt as
      `$NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` etc.

    </Tip>
  </Step>

## Example Prompts & Workflows

Now you can use natural language prompts to automate Notion. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Notion MCP tools.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Documentation" icon="code">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Generate API documentation for all endpoints in src/api/routes
    with request/response schemas. Create a page in the
    Technical Docs database with authentication requirements.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sprint Planning from Code" icon="list-checks">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Scan the codebase for TODO and FIXME comments. Create tasks
    in the Engineering Backlog database with code context,
    file paths, and estimated complexity.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Launch Week Orchestration" icon="rocket">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Review commits since last release and my Launch Ideas notes.
    Generate a Launch Week page with: feature announcements,
    daily checklists, draft X/LinkedIn posts, and demo scripts.
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="RFC from Discussion" icon="comments">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Turn our Slack architecture discussion from #eng-design into
    a proper RFC. Include problem statement, proposed solution,
    alternatives considered, and implementation timeline.
    ```

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Tool Workflows

Combine Notion with other MCPs for powerful automation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Notion + GitHub" icon="github">
    ```
    "Analyze all merged PRs this sprint, extract feature
    descriptions and breaking changes, then create a
    technical changelog in Notion with links to PRs."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Notion + PostHog" icon="chart-bar">
    ```
    "Pull feature adoption metrics from PostHog for our last
    release. Create a product insights page with usage graphs,
    user segments, and recommendations for improvements."
    ```
    See the [PostHog Analytics Guide](/guides/posthog-github-continuous-ai)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Code Review Insights" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **🎯 Outside the Box:**
    ```
    "Analyze my code review comments from the past month.
    Create a 'Personal Code Review Patterns' page highlighting
    what I catch most often and blind spots to improve."
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Notion + Linear" icon="list">
    ```
    "Sync Linear issues tagged 'customer-reported' to Notion's
    Customer Feedback database. Add impact scores based on
    number of duplicate reports and affected users."
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>

  **Protect Your API Keys:**
  - Treat `NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` like a password → rotate every 90 days
  - Grant the integration only required page/database access
  - Use Continue's secrets, never commit tokens to git
  - Monitor token usage for unusual activity

</Warning>
