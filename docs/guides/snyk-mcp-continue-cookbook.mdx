<Note>

  **🚀 New: Snyk Mission Control Integration with Continuous AI**
  
  The new [Snyk Mission Control Integration](/mission-control/integrations/snyk) enables **[Continuous AI](/guides/continuous-ai)** - where AI agents autonomously detect, analyze, and fix vulnerabilities. When Snyk detects an issue, your agent automatically generates a fix, creates a PR, and validates the solution without manual intervention.
  
  **Mission Control Benefits:**
  - **One-click OAuth** - No tokens, no configuration files, just connect and go
  - **Centralized workflows** - Manage all security Tasks and automations from one dashboard
  - **Webhook triggers** - Automatically respond to new vulnerabilities as they're discovered
  - **Metrics & intervention rates** - Track how often agents successfully fix issues without human help
  
  This represents **[Level 2 Continuous AI](/guides/continuous-ai#the-continuous-ai-maturity-model)**: AI handles routine security work autonomously while developers focus on complex problems. As outlined in our [Continuous AI guide](/guides/continuous-ai#best-practices-for-sustainable-continuous-ai), this reduces intervention rates and accelerates secure development.
  
  **Get Started:** Use this cookbook to understand the fundamentals, then [enable Mission Control](/mission-control/integrations/snyk) to deploy autonomous security agents across your organization.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Continue account with **Hub access**
- Read: [Understanding Configs — How to get started with Hub configs](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs)
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Snyk account](https://snyk.io/) (free tier works)
- A local project to scan for vulnerabilities

For all options, first:
<Steps>
<Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
  </Step>

<Step title="Add Your Project to Snyk">

  1. Sign up for a Snyk account at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/)
  2. Create a new project in Snyk by importing your code repository (Git 
  provider or manual upload)
  3. Install and authenticate the Snyk CLI locally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g snyk
     snyk auth
     ```
     This will open your browser to authenticate with your Snyk account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Important**: The Snyk MCP requires the Snyk CLI to be authenticated locally. Run `snyk auth` to authenticate before using the Continue agent with Snyk MCP.
</Note>
 <Warning>
  To use agents in headless mode, you need a [Continue API key](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys).
  </Warning>

## Snyk Continuous AI Workflow Options

<Card title="🚀 Fastest Path to Success" icon="zap">
  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built Snyk Continuous AI agent that includes
  the Snyk MCP and optimized security scanning workflows for more consistent results.
</Card>


After ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Load the Pre-Built Agent">
        Navigate to your project directory and run:
        ```bash
        cn --agent continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent
        ```

        This agent includes:
        - **Snyk MCP** pre-configured and ready to use
        - **Security-focused rules** for best practices
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Your First Security Scan">
        From your project directory, start with a comprehensive security scan:
        ```bash
         # Headless mode
        cn -p "Run a complete security scan on this project including code vulnerabilities, dependencies, and any IaC files. Summarize findings by severity." --auto
        ```

        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Why Use the Agent?** The pre-built agent provides consistent security scanning workflows and handles MCP configuration automatically, making it easier to get started with AI-powered security scanning.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🛠️ Manual Setup">
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent via the Continue Mission Control">
    Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
    </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Snyk MCP via Continue Mission Control">
    Visit the [Snyk Continuous AI Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent) and click **Install** to add it to the agent you created in the step above.

    This will add Snyk MCP to your agent's available tools. The Mission Control listing automatically configures the MCP command:
    ```bash
    npx -y snyk@latest mcp -t stdio
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Alternative installation methods:**
      1. **Quick CLI install**: `cn --mcp snyk/snyk-mcp`
      2. **Manual configuration**: Add the MCP to your `~/.continue/config.json` under the `mcpServers` section

      Once installed, Snyk MCP tools become available to your Continue agent for all prompts.
    </Tip>

    <Info>
      The MCP will request authentication and folder trust permissions when first used.
      This is handled automatically by the Continue agent.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secure-at-Inception Rules">
    Install the [Snyk Secure-at-Inception rules](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/secure-at-inception) from Mission Control to enable automatic security scanning.

    **How to add rules to your agent:**
    1. Visit the rules link above and click **Install**
    2. The rules will be added to your agent configuration automatically
    3. Rules apply globally to all your Continue sessions

    These rules configure your agent to:
    - **Run [SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/sast/) scans** on newly generated or modified code
    - **Check dependencies** when adding or updating packages
    - **Auto-fix issues** using Snyk's recommendations, then rescan

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your First Security Scan">
    Start with a comprehensive security scan:
    ```bash
    # TUI mode
    cn "Run a complete security scan on this project including code vulnerabilities, dependencies, and any IaC files. Summarize findings by severity."
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Agent Requirements">
    To use the pre-built agent, you need either: 
      - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR 
      - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Mission Control secrets (same as manual setup)
      
    The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration along with the pre-configured Snyk MCP for security scanning operations.

</Accordion>

---

## Security Scanning Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to run comprehensive security scans. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Snyk MCP tools.

<Info>
You can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt" --auto` for headless commands

  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running security scans that might make
  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode
  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This
  shows you what the agent will do without executing it. For example: `"Run a
  Snyk Code scan and fix the top 3 issues"`

## Continuous Security with GitHub Actions

This example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where security scanning runs automatically on pull requests, generates AI-powered mitigation suggestions, and posts them as PR comments.

<Info>

  **About the --auto flag**: The `--auto` flag enables tools to run continuously without manual confirmation. This is essential for headless mode where the agent needs to execute multiple tools automatically to complete tasks like security scanning, vulnerability analysis, and fix validation.

</Info>

### Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Your Snyk authentication token from [app.snyk.io/account](https://app.snyk.io/account)

### Create Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/snyk-security.yml` in your repository:

<Info>
  **About SNYK_TOKEN**: The workflow uses the SNYK_TOKEN in two ways:
  1. **Direct Snyk CLI authentication** - Authenticates the Snyk CLI for running scans
  2. **Continue CLI access** - Available as an environment variable when Continue generates AI mitigation suggestions

  The `cn` agent automatically uses the SNYK_TOKEN when needed for Snyk MCP operations.
</Info>

<Info>
  This workflow demonstrates several advanced features:

## Security Guardrails

Implement automated security policies using Continue's rule system. See the [Rules deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/rules) for authoring tips.

<Note>
  **Coming Soon**: These security guardrail prompts will be available as pre-configured rules on the Continue Mission Control for easy installation.

<Tip>
  Enable the **Secure-at-Inception** rules from Mission Control to automatically apply
  these guardrails to all code generation and modifications.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

```bash
"Check Snyk auth status and current org. If not authenticated,
help me authenticate. Then run a quick Code scan on ./
with severity medium and print one example issue."
```

### Fix Validation

```bash
"Propose minimal diffs only in affected files,
then rerun the same Snyk scan to confirm resolution."
```

### Connection Problems

<Check>
  **Verification Steps:** - Snyk MCP is installed via [Continue
  Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/snyk-mcp) - Secure-at-Inception rules are
  [enabled](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/secure-at-inception) - Authentication
  completed successfully - Project folder has been trusted
