<Warning>
  Instinct is a 7 billion parameter model. You should expect slow responses if
  running on a laptop. To learn how to inference Instinct on a GPU, see our
  [HuggingFace model card](https://huggingface.co/continuedev/instinct).
</Warning>

We recently released Instinct, a state-of-the-art open Next Edit model. Robustly fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, Instinct intelligently predicts your next move to keep you in flow. To learn more about the model, check out [our blog post](https://blog.continue.dev).
