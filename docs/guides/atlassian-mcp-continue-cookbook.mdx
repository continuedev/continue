<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="atlassian">
  An Atlassian workflow assistant that uses Continue with the Atlassian Rovo MCP to:
  - Search and summarize Jira issues across projects
  - Find and digest Confluence documentation
  - Create and update Jira issues with natural language
  - Query Compass components and service dependencies
  - Automate Atlassian workflows with headless CLI runs
</Card>

<Info>
  The new [Atlassian Mission Control Integration](/mission-control/integrations/atlassian) enables **[Continuous AI](/guides/continuous-ai)** for project management and documentation - where AI agents autonomously manage Jira issues, sync Confluence documentation, and streamline development workflows. This cookbook focuses on CLI-based workflows, but you can also deploy autonomous agents through Mission Control.

  **Get Started:** Use this cookbook to understand Atlassian MCP fundamentals, then [enable Mission Control](/mission-control/integrations/atlassian) to deploy autonomous project management agents across your organization.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Continue account with **Hub access**
  - Read: [Understanding Configs — How to get started with Hub configs](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs)
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- An Atlassian Cloud site with Jira, Confluence, and/or Compass
- Access to the Atlassian products you want to integrate with

<Note>
  The Atlassian Rovo MCP Server is currently in **Beta**. Core functionality is available, but some features are still under development.
</Note>

For all options, first:
<Steps>
<Step title="Install Continue CLI">
  ```bash
  npm i -g @continuedev/cli
  ```
  </Step>

<Step title="Understand OAuth Flow">
  The Atlassian MCP uses **OAuth 2.1** for authentication. The first time you connect, you'll complete a browser-based authorization flow that respects your existing Atlassian permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  To use agents in headless mode, you need a [Continue API key](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys).
  All data access respects your existing Jira, Confluence, and Compass user permissions.
</Warning>

## Choose Your Atlassian Agent

<Card title="🚀 Two Specialized Agents" icon="rocket">
  We've created two ready-to-use agents to help you get started fast - they come pre-configured with optimized prompts, rules, and the Atlassian MCP. You don't have to use these agents, but they're designed to give you the best experience right away. Choose the agent that matches your needs, or create your own custom agent.
</Card>

### Agent Quick Reference

| Agent | Best For | Use Cases | Link |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| **Jira Agent** | Issue Management | Search issues, create stories, sprint planning, status updates, bulk operations | [View Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/atlassian-continuous-ai-jira-agent) |
| **Confluence Agent** | Documentation | Search pages, summarize docs, create/update pages, manage spaces | [View Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/atlassian-continuous-ai-confluence-agent) |

<Note>
  **Cross-product workflows**: Both agents can work with Jira, Confluence, and Compass. Choose based on your primary focus area, or create your own agent using the [Atlassian MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/atlassian/atlassian-mcp). The Atlassian MCP can work with Jira, Compass, or Confluence.

      <Step title="Run Your First Command">
        From anywhere in your terminal:
        ```bash
        cn --agent continuedev/atlassian-continuous-ai-jira-agent "Show me my open issues assigned to me"
        ```
        The agent will connect to your Atlassian site and return results.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Pro tip**: Create a shell alias for the Jira agent:
      ```bash
      alias jira-ai='cn --agent continuedev/atlassian-continuous-ai-jira-agent'
      ```
      Then use: `jira-ai "your prompt"`

  <Tab title="🛠️ Manual Setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a New Agent on Continue Mission Control">
        Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Atlassian MCP">
        Install from Hub (recommended) or add YAML manually. Minimal YAML example:

        ```yaml title="config.yaml"
        name: My Config
        version: 0.0.1
        schema: v1

        mcpServers:
          - name: Atlassian Rovo MCP
            type: sse
            url: https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
            connectionTimeout: 30
        ```

        Notes:
        - The Atlassian MCP uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** transport type
        - OAuth is handled automatically on first connection
        - No API keys or tokens needed in the config
      </Step>

      <Step title="Test the Connection">
        Launch Continue and ask:
        ```
        List my Jira projects
        ```
        You'll be prompted to authorize in your browser if this is your first time.

<Info>
  **Running in headless mode**: Add `-p` flag before your prompt and `--auto` flag at the end:
  ```bash
  cn --agent continuedev/atlassian-continuous-ai-jira-agent -p "your prompt" --auto

  - Use **Confluence Agent** when the workflow is documentation-centric
</Note>

Integrate actions across Jira, Confluence, and Compass for powerful cross-product workflows.

<Info>
  **Running in headless mode**: Add `-p` flag before your prompt and `--auto` flag at the end. Complete browser OAuth authentication first before using headless mode.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth Authorization Issues">
    - **"Your site admin must authorize this app"**: A site admin needs to complete the OAuth flow first before other users can connect
    - **Can't complete browser authorization**: Ensure you're logged into the correct Atlassian Cloud site and have necessary permissions
    - **Connection timeout**: Increase `connectionTimeout` in your MCP config or check your network connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Errors">
    - **"Access denied" or "Forbidden"**: The MCP respects your existing Atlassian permissions. Verify you have access to the project/space/component you're trying to access
    - **Can't create issues**: Ensure you have "Create issues" permission in the target Jira project
    - **Can't edit Confluence pages**: Verify you have edit permissions in the target Confluence space
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
    - **Standard plan**: Moderate usage thresholds
    - **Premium/Enterprise plans**: Higher quotas (1,000 requests/hour plus per-user limits)
    - If you hit rate limits, reduce query frequency or batch operations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Beta Limitations">
    - Bulk operations may be constrained by rate limits
    - Custom Jira fields may not be recognized without explicit setup
    - Workspace/site switching not available within a single session
    - Check [Atlassian Community](https://community.atlassian.com/) for known issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Admin Considerations

<Card title="For Atlassian Site Admins" icon="shield">
  **Installation**: The Atlassian Rovo MCP is automatically installed on first OAuth authorization (JIT installation) - no Marketplace installation needed.

  **Managing Access**:
  - View connected apps in [Admin Hub](https://admin.atlassian.com)
  - Users can revoke access from their [profile settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/apps)
  - Block user-installed apps via "user-installed apps" control in Admin Hub

  **Security**: All traffic is encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), and access respects existing user permissions.
</Card>
