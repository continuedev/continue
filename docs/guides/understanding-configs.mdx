Every developer has unique needs when it comes to AI assistance. Some prefer the convenience of cloud-managed configurations, while others need the control and privacy of local setups. Continue offers both paths, and this guide will help you choose the right one for your workflow.

## What Are the Two Paths to AI Assistance?

Continue provides two distinct ways to configure:

Think of Continue's configuration options like choosing between a managed service and self-hosting. Both get you to the same destination—powerful AI assistance in your IDE—but the journey and control level differ significantly.

### How to Access Your Configuration

Before we dive into the specifics, let's understand how to access your configuration:

1. Open the Continue Chat sidebar by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains)
2. Click the Config selector above the main chat input
3. Hover over a config and click:
   - `new window` icon for Hub configs
   - `gear` icon for Local configs

## What Are Hub Configurations: The Managed Experience

Hub Configurations represent the "it just works" philosophy. When you [sign in to Continue Mission Control](https://auth.continue.dev/), you gain access to a curated ecosystem of established configurations that sync seamlessly across all your development environments.

### Why Should You Choose Hub Configs?

**The Power of Simplicity**

- **Instant Setup**: Browse the [configuration marketplace](https://hub.continue.dev) and add any config to your account with a single click
- **Web-Based Management**: Configure models, add secrets, and customize settings through an intuitive web interface—no JSON editing required
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Make a change on Mission Control, and it reflects immediately across all your IDE instances
- **Team Collaboration**: Share custom configurations with your team, ensuring everyone uses the same optimized configurations

### How to Get Started with Hub Configs

The journey from zero to AI-powered coding takes just four steps:

1. **Select Your Config**: Click the config selector in your IDE's Continue panel
2. **Explore or Create**: Browse community configurations or craft your own specialized setup
3. **Secure Your Keys**: Add API keys as [User Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets) in Mission Control—they're encrypted and never exposed
4. **Sync and Code**: Click "Reload config" to pull your latest settings

Pro tip: Hub configurations are perfect for teams. Create a custom config with your team's coding standards, preferred models, and context sources, then share it with a simple link.

### How to Manage Hub Configs

All Hub config management happens through [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev). For detailed customization, see our guide on [Editing a Config](/mission-control/configs/edit-a-config).

## What Are Local Configs: The Power User's Choice

Local configuration puts you in the driver's seat. Using a `config.yaml` file, you have complete control over every aspect of your Continue experience with all configuration stored directly on your machine.

### Why Should You Choose Local Configs?

**Complete Control and Privacy**

- **Your Data, Your Rules**: All configuration stays on your machine—perfect for air-gapped environments or strict data policies
- **Version Control Integration**: Check your `config.yaml` into git alongside your code, ensuring reproducible environments
- **Offline Capability**: Once configured, no internet connection needed (assuming you're using local models)
- **Unlimited Customization**: Access every configuration option, experimental feature, and advanced setting

### How to Set Up Local Configs

Local configuration lives in a single YAML file in your home directory:

**File Locations:**

- macOS/Linux: `~/.continue/config.yaml`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.yaml`

**Quick Access Method:**

1. Open the configs dropdown in your IDE
2. Click the gear icon next to "Local Config"
3. The `config.yaml` file opens in your editor

### The Local Config Experience

When you edit your `config.yaml`, Continue provides intelligent autocomplete for all available options. Save the file, and Continue automatically reloads your configuration—no restart required.

The first time you use Continue, it generates a `config.yaml` with sensible defaults. From there, you can customize everything from model selection to context providers, slash commands, and more.

For the complete configuration reference, see our [config.yaml documentation](/reference).

## How to Make the Right Choice

The decision between Hub and Local configs often comes down to your specific needs and constraints. Here's a framework to help you decide:

### Choose Hub Configs When You:

**Value Convenience Over Control**

- Want to start coding with AI assistance in under 60 seconds
- Prefer visual interfaces over editing configuration files
- Need to switch between multiple machines frequently
- Work in a team that needs standardized AI assistance

**Need Advanced Collaboration**

- Want to share custom configs with teammates
- Need centralized API key management
- Require quick updates across your entire organization

**Are Getting Started**

- New to AI-powered development
- Want to experiment with different models and configurations
- Prefer guided setup experiences

### Choose Local Configs When You:

**Require Maximum Control**

- Need to version control your exact configuration
- Want to customize every aspect of the AI behavior
- Require reproducible development environments

**Have Privacy Requirements**

- Work with sensitive code that requires air-gapped environments
- Need to ensure all configuration data stays local
- Have strict compliance requirements about data storage

**Are a Power User**

- Comfortable editing YAML/JSON files
- Want access to experimental features
- Need to integrate with local tools and scripts

## How to Use the Hybrid Approach

Here's a secret: you don't have to choose just one. Many developers use both approaches:

- **Hub Configs** for general development and experimentation
- **Local Configs** for production work or client projects with specific requirements

You can switch between them seamlessly using the configs selector in your IDE.

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### For Hub Config Users

1. **Start with Community Configs**: Before creating your own, explore what others have built
2. **Use Secrets Properly**: Never hardcode API keys—always use the User Secrets feature
3. **Create Specialized Configs**: Make different configs for different contexts (frontend, backend, DevOps)
4. **Share Liberally**: If you create something useful, share it with the community

### For Local Config Users

1. **Version Control Your Config**: Treat your `config.yaml` like code—commit it, review changes, and maintain history
2. **Use Environment Variables**: For sensitive data, reference environment variables instead of hardcoding values
3. **Document Your Setup**: Add comments to your config explaining non-obvious choices
4. **Keep a Backup**: Before major changes, save a working copy of your configuration

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Hub Config Issues

**Changes Not Reflecting?**

- Click "Reload config" in your IDE
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you're signed in to the correct account

**Config Not Available?**

- Verify it's added to your account on Mission Control
- Check if it requires specific API keys

### Local Config Issues

**Config Not Loading?**

- Verify file location matches your OS
- Check YAML syntax (Continue will show errors)
- Ensure file permissions allow reading

**Autocomplete Not Working?**

- Update to the latest Continue version
- Check that you're editing the correct file

## Next Steps

Now that you understand both configuration approaches, you're ready to dive deeper:

  - **For Hub Users**: [Create A Config](/mission-control/configs/create-a-config)
- **For Local Users**: [Explore the Config Reference](/reference)
- **For Everyone**: [Discover Available Models](/customize/model-providers/overview)

Remember, the best configuration is the one that helps you code more effectively. Start simple, experiment freely, and gradually refine your setup as you discover what works best for your workflow.

Happy coding with Continue! 🚀
