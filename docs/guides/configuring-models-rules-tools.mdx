title: "Configuring Models, Rules, and Tools"
description: "Learn how to work with Continue's configuration system. Understand how to use hub models, rules, and tools, create local configurations, and organize your setup for maximum reusability."

## What Are Models, Rules, and Tools?

Continue agents are built from three main types of configuration:

<Columns cols={3}>
<Card title="Models" icon="cube">
Language models that power different capabilities like chat, autocomplete, and agent mode
</Card>

<Card title="Rules" icon="pencil">
  Guidelines and instructions that shape how the AI behaves and responds
</Card>

<Card title="Tools" icon="server">
MCP tools that provide additional capabilities like database access, web search, or custom functions
</Card>
</Columns>

There are two places where you can define these configurations:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="Local" icon="computer">
Custom configurations you create and manage in your workspace or globally
</Card>

<Card title="Hub" icon="cloud">
Pre-built models, rules, and tools from the Continue community that you can import and use immediately
</Card>
</Columns>

## Local

Local configurations let you create custom models, rules, and tools that automatically apply to multiple agents, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency across your setup.

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="Global" icon="globe">
Applied to all agents across all workspaces. Ideal for personal preferences, universal coding standards, or tools you use everywhere.
</Card>
<Card title="Workspace" icon="folder-open">
Applied automatically to all agents when working in a specific project.

Perfect for project-specific setups like TypeScript rules for web apps or the Playwright MCP tool.

</Card>

</Columns>

## Hub

Continue hub uses a slug in the format of `owner/item-name` to resolve blocks.

For example, to use the [Claude 4 Sonnet model](https://hub.continue.dev/anthropic/claude-4-sonnet), you'd reference it as `anthropic/claude-4-sonnet`.

Import from the hub using the `uses` syntax alongside your custom configurations:

```yaml config.yaml highlight={6}
name: Team Agent
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - uses: anthropic/claude-4-sonnet
    with:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }} # Use a hub secret
```

### Organization

Organize your local configurations using these directories:

<Columns cols={3}>
<Card title="Models" icon="cube">
  `.continue/models`
</Card>

<Card title="Rules" icon="pencil">
  `.continue/rules`
</Card>

<Card title="Tools" icon="server">
  `.continue/mcpServers`
</Card>
</Columns>

## Working with Secrets

Models, and many MCP servers, require a secret for things like API keys.

On the hub, you can configure secrets when adding a model or MCP server.

This will use mustache notation to pass the secret, eg `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

When configuring a local model or MCP server, you can use the same mustache notation for secrets which read from:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="Global" icon="globe">
`.env` file in `~/.continue/.env`
</Card>

<Card title="Workspace" icon="folder-open">
`.env` file at your project root
</Card>
</Columns>

## Overriding Properties

You can directly override properties using the `override` syntax:

```yaml title="config.yaml" highlight={10-13}
name: myprofile/custom-agent
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - uses: myprofile/custom-model
    with:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      TEMP: 0.9
    override:
      roles:
        - chat
```

## Advanced

### Inputs

Models and MCP server authors can configure inputs that require the user to provide a secret value by defining a `${{ inputs.SECRET_NAME }}` value.

For example, here is how you could require that the user provide a value for the `apiKey` property on a model:

```yaml title="config.yaml" highlight={8}
name: myprofile/custom-model
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - name: My Favorite Model
    # ... other model properties ...
    apiKey: ${{ inputs.SECRET_NAME }}
```

Users then map their secret to this input using a `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` value that maps to a property name which matches the required input, e.g. `SECRET_NAME`.

```yaml title="config.yaml" highlight={8}
name: myprofile/custom-agent
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - uses: myprofile/custom-model
    with:
      SECRET_NAME: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```
