<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="bug">
  An automated error monitoring system that uses Continue CLI with Sentry MCP to analyze production errors, identify root causes with AI, and create detailed GitHub issues with suggested fixes.
</Card>

## What You'll Learn

This cookbook teaches you to:

- Use [Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) to access [issues](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/)
- Analyze error patterns and stack traces with AI

- Automatically create GitHub issues with root cause analysis
- Set up continuous error monitoring with GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- GitHub repository where you want to create issues
- [Sentry account](https://sentry.io) with an active project collecting errors
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli) with **active credits** (required for API usage)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed (`gh` command)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Continue CLI Account & API Key">
    1. Visit [Continue Organizations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations)
    2. Sign up or log in to your Continue account
    3. Navigate to your organization settings
    4. Click **"API Keys"** and then **"+ New API Key"**
    5. Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again!)
    6. Login to the CLI: `cn login`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Continue CLI handles complex error analysis and API interactions - you just need to provide the right prompts!
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials

First, you'll need to gather your Sentry and GitHub API credentials.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configure Sentry MCP">

    <Tip>
      See [Sentry MCP Documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) for detailed configuration options
    </Tip>

    The Sentry MCP supports multiple configuration methods. For Continue CLI, OAuth is recommended:

    **Option 1: OAuth Configuration (Recommended)**

    The Sentry MCP will prompt for OAuth authentication when first used. Simply follow the authorization flow.

    **Option 2: STDIO Mode with Auth Token**

    For local development or self-hosted Sentry installations, you can use STDIO mode:
    ```bash
    npx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=YOUR_SENTRY_TOKEN --host=sentry.io
    ```

    Or use environment variables:
    ```bash
    SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token SENTRY_HOST=sentry.io
    ```

    <Info>
      The `--host` parameter is required and should point to your Sentry instance (e.g., `sentry.io` or `sentry.example.com` for self-hosted).
    </Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sentry API Credentials">
    You'll need a **Sentry User Auth Token** to access issues and error data:

    1. Go to [User Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) in Sentry
       - For self-hosted Sentry, use: `https://YOUR-SENTRY-DOMAIN/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`
    2. Click **Create New Token**
    3. Name it "Continue CLI Error Analysis"
    4. **Select these permission scopes** (required for full functionality):
       - `org:read` - **Required** - Access organization information
       - `project:read` - **Required** - Read project configurations
       - `project:releases` - **Required** - Access release information for deployment tracking
       - `event:read` - **Required** - Read detailed error event data and stack traces
       - `event:write` - Optional - Update error events (for marking as resolved)
       - `member:read` - Recommended - Read team member information for auto-assignment
       - `team:read` - Recommended - Access team data for routing issues
    5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
    6. Note your organization slug (found in your Sentry URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR-ORG-SLUG`)
    7. Note your Sentry host URL (typically `https://sentry.io` or your self-hosted domain)

    <Info>
      **Sentry MCP Connection**: The MCP server connects via OAuth to `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp` and handles authentication securely. For local development, you can use STDIO mode with your auth token.
    </Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Set Up GitHub CLI Authentication">
   GitHub CLI handles authentication automatically - no manual PAT needed:

    1. Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
    2. Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts
    3. Choose authentication method (browser or token)
    4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted (`issues:write` is **required** for creating issues)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Sentry Error Monitoring Workflow Options

<Card title="üöÄ Fastest Path to Success" icon="zap">
  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built Sentry Continuous AI agent that includes
  optimized prompts, rules, and the Sentry MCP for more consistent results.
</Card>

<Info>
  **How Sentry MCP Works**:
  - Connects to your Sentry organization via OAuth
  - Provides tools for accessing issues, projects, teams, and DSNs
  - Supports both hosted (`https://mcp.sentry.dev`) and self-hosted Sentry instances
  - Automatically handles authentication and API interactions
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="‚ö° Quick Start (Recommended)">
    **Perfect for:** Immediate error analysis with AI-powered root cause detection and built-in debugging

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add the Pre-Built Agent">
        Visit the [Sentry Continuous AI Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/sentry-continuous-ai) on Continue Hub and click **"Install Agent"** or run:
        
        ```bash
        cn --config continuedev/sentry-continuous-ai
        ```

        This agent includes:
        - **Optimized prompts** for Sentry error analysis and GitHub issue creation
        - **Built-in rules** for consistent formatting and error handling
        - **[Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/)** for more reliable API interactions
        - **Automatic authentication** via OAuth flow
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Error Analysis">
        Navigate to your project directory and enter this prompt in the Continue CLI TUI:
        
        ```
        Analyze recent Sentry errors and create GitHub issues for critical bugs with suggested fixes
        ```

        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Why Use the Agent?** Results are more consistent and debugging is easier thanks to the Sentry MCP integration and pre-tested prompts.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Sentry MCP to Continue CLI">
        Configure the [Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) using OAuth:

        The MCP server will automatically prompt for OAuth authentication when you first use it.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify Sentry Connection">
        Test your Sentry MCP connection with this prompt:
        
        ```
        List my Sentry organizations and projects
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Custom Error Analysis Prompts">
        Use this prompt template with Continue CLI to analyze Sentry errors:

        ```
        Analyze Sentry errors from the past 24 hours:
        - Group errors by root cause
        - Identify the top 5 most critical issues by frequency and impact
        - For each critical issue, provide:
          * Stack trace analysis
          * Affected user count
          * First seen and last seen timestamps
          * Suggested fix based on error context
        - Create GitHub issues using gh CLI with:
          * Title format: 'üêõ [Sentry] [Error Type]: Brief description'
          * Labels: 'bug', 'sentry', 'production'
          * Priority labels based on severity
          * Full error context and suggested fix in the body
        Execute the commands and confirm each issue was created.
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Why GitHub CLI over GitHub MCP**: While GitHub MCP is available, it can be
  token-expensive to run. The `gh` CLI is more efficient, requires no API tokens
  (authenticated via `gh auth login`), and provides a cleaner command-line
  experience. GitHub MCP remains an option if you prefer full MCP integration.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Agent Requirements">
  To use the pre-built agent, you need either:
  - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR
  - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Hub secrets (same as Step 1)
  
  The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration. For Sentry MCP:
  - **Sentry account** with at least one project
  - **User Auth Token** with appropriate scopes (or OAuth flow)
  - The MCP works with both Sentry's hosted service (`sentry.io`) and self-hosted instances
</Accordion>

---

<Warning>
  **Repository Labels Required**: Make sure your GitHub repository has these labels:
  - `bug`, `sentry`, `production`
  - `critical`, `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`
  - `needs-investigation`, `has-fix`

  Create missing labels in your repo at: **Settings ‚Üí Labels ‚Üí New label**
</Warning>

## Step 2: Analyze Sentry Errors with AI

Use Continue CLI to perform intelligent error analysis. Enter these prompts in the Continue CLI TUI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Recent Errors Analysis">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Show me Sentry errors from the past 7 days, grouped by error type, with frequency counts
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Critical Error Investigation">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Find the most critical Sentry error affecting the most users in production and provide:
    - Full stack trace analysis
    - Affected user count and browser/OS breakdown
    - Timeline of when the error started occurring
    - Similar historical issues from Sentry
    - Root cause hypothesis based on code context
    - Suggested fix with code examples
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Performance Issue Detection">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Analyze Sentry performance data to identify:
    - Slowest transactions in the past 24 hours
    - Database queries with high latency
    - API endpoints with degraded performance
    - Suggested optimizations for each issue
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Available Sentry MCP Tools**:
  - **Organizations**: Access org-level data and settings
  - **Projects**: Query projects and their configurations
  - **Issues**: Search and analyze error issues
  - **Teams**: Manage team assignments
  - **DSNs**: Retrieve project DSN configurations

</Info>

## Step 3: Automate GitHub Issue Creation

Create actionable GitHub issues from Sentry errors. Enter this prompt in the Continue CLI TUI:

**Prompt:**
```
For each unresolved Sentry error with 'critical' or 'high' severity:
1. Analyze the error using Sentry MCP
2. Create a GitHub issue with gh CLI:
   - Title: 'üêõ [Sentry] [Error Type]: Brief description'
   - Body with:
     * Error summary and impact (affected users, frequency)
     * Full stack trace
     * Environment details (browser, OS, release version)
     * Link to Sentry issue
     * Root cause analysis from AI
     * Suggested fix with code snippets
     * Related Sentry issues
   - Labels: 'bug', 'sentry', 'production', and severity label
   - Assignees: Team member based on code ownership
3. Update Sentry issue with GitHub issue link
4. Confirm creation with GitHub issue URL
```

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Link GitHub issues back to Sentry for full traceability. This creates a bidirectional connection between your error monitoring and issue tracking.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Set Up Continuous Monitoring with GitHub Actions

Automate error monitoring to run daily and create issues for new critical errors:

```yaml
name: Sentry Error Monitoring

on:
  schedule:
    # Run every 6 hours
    - cron: "0 */6 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers

jobs:
  monitor-errors:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22"

      - name: Install Continue CLI
        run: |
          npm install -g @continuedev/cli
          echo "‚úÖ Continue CLI installed"

      - name: Authenticate GitHub CLI
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" | gh auth login --with-token
          echo "‚úÖ GitHub CLI authenticated"

      - name: Analyze Sentry Errors and Create Issues
        env:
          CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}
        run: |
          echo "üîç Analyzing Sentry errors..."
          cn -p "Using Sentry MCP, analyze errors from the past 6 hours:
                 1. Filter for unresolved errors with high or critical severity
                 2. Group similar errors to avoid duplicates
                 3. For each unique critical error:
                    - Check if a GitHub issue already exists for this error
                    - If not, create a new issue with full analysis
                    - Use gh CLI: gh issue create --title 'title' --body 'body' --label 'bug,sentry,critical'
                 4. Output summary with created issue URLs

                 Sentry Organization: $SENTRY_ORG
                 Only process errors not already tracked in GitHub."

      - name: Comment on workflow run
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "‚úÖ Sentry monitoring complete. Check step output for created issues."
```

<Warning>
  **Required GitHub Secrets**:
  - `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
  - `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Sentry User Auth Token
  - `SENTRY_ORG`: Your Sentry organization slug
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

  Add these at: **Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Workflow Best Practices**:
  - Run every 6 hours to catch critical errors quickly
  - Use duplicate detection to avoid creating multiple issues for the same error
  - Filter by severity to focus on high-impact issues
  - Include full error context and suggested fixes in issues
  - Tag issues with appropriate labels for team routing

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Protect Your API Keys**:
  - Store all credentials as GitHub Secrets, never in code
  - Use Continue CLI's secure secret storage
  - Limit Sentry token scopes to minimum required permissions
  - Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
  - Monitor token usage for unusual activity
  - Use OAuth when possible for better security
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Sentry MCP Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify OAuth authentication is complete
2. Check your Sentry organization access
3. Ensure the MCP server URL is correct (`https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp`)
4. For self-hosted Sentry, verify your host URL is configured correctly

See the [Sentry MCP GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues) for known issues and solutions.

### Common Error Analysis Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|:------|:---------|
| No errors returned | Verify your Sentry project has collected errors recently |
| OAuth prompt not appearing | Check that Continue CLI has proper MCP configuration |
| Duplicate GitHub issues | Implement duplicate detection in your prompts |
| Missing error context | Ensure your Sentry token has `event:read` scope |
