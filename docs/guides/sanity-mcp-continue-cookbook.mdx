</CardGroup>

<Info>
**New to MCP?** These prompts demonstrate the power of natural language content management. For more examples and detailed explanations, check out the [official Sanity MCP blog post](https://www.sanity.io/blog/model-context-protocol).
</Info>

## Content Management Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to manage your Sanity content and schemas. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Sanity MCP tools.

<Info>
You can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt"` for headless commands

  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running operations that might make
  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode
  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This
  shows you what the agent will do without executing it.
</Info>

<Info>

  **About the --auto flag**: The `--auto` flag enables tools to run continuously without manual confirmation. This is essential for headless mode where the agent needs to execute multiple tools automatically to complete tasks like schema exploration, GROQ execution, and content migration.

## Continuous Content Management with GitHub Actions

  This example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where content validation and schema checks run automatically in your CI/CD pipeline in headless mode using the Sanity agent config. Consider [remixing this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to add your organization's specific content governance rules.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
- `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID
- `SANITY_DATASET`: Your Sanity dataset name (usually "production")
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN`: Your Sanity API token with appropriate permissions
- `MCP_USER_ROLE`: Your MCP user role (typically "admin" or "editor")

<Info>
  The workflow uses the [Sanity Assistant Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/sanity-assistant-agent) with environment variable authentication via [Sanity MCP Config](https://hub.continue.dev/sanity/sanity-mcp-config). This enables headless mode operation without OAuth browser authentication.
</Info>

### Create Workflow File

This workflow automatically validates your Sanity schemas and content on pull requests using the Continue CLI in [headless mode](/cli/overview#headless-mode%3A-production-automation). It checks schema integrity, validates content relationships, and posts a summary report as a PR comment.

Create `.github/workflows/sanity-content-validation.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Sanity Content Validation with MCP

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate-content:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:

  Environment variables enable the MCP to authenticate without OAuth browser prompts. The [Sanity MCP Config](https://hub.continue.dev/sanity/sanity-mcp-config) documentation provides detailed setup instructions for all required variables.
</Info>

## Content Management Best Practices

Implement automated content quality checks using Continue's rule system. See the [Rules deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/rules) for authoring tips.

<Card title="Schema Validation" icon="check-circle">
  ```bash
  "Before deploying schema changes, validate that all required fields
  are present and that no breaking changes affect existing content."
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="Content Consistency" icon="shield-exclamation">
  ```bash
  "When creating new content types, ensure they follow the existing
  naming conventions and field patterns established in the schema."
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="Query Optimization" icon="gauge-high">
  ```bash
  "Review GROQ queries for performance issues and suggest indexes
  or query restructuring to improve response times."
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="Localization Standards" icon="check-double">
  ```bash
  "Ensure all user-facing content fields have proper localization
  support configured for the required languages."
  ```
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

```bash
"Check if I'm properly authenticated with Sanity.
If not, help me set up OAuth or API token authentication."
```

### Schema Not Found

```bash
"Verify that the Sanity project is properly configured
and that the schema files are accessible in the current directory."
```

### GROQ Query Errors

```bash
"Debug this GROQ query and explain why it's failing,
then provide a corrected version that achieves the intended result."
```

### Migration Conflicts

<Check>
  **Verification Steps:**
  - Sanity MCP is installed via [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/sanity/sanity-mcp)
  - Project is authenticated with Sanity
  - Schema files are present and valid
  - Dataset permissions are correctly configured
</Check>
