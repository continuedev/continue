<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
  A communication workflow assistant that uses Continue CLI with Klavis AI's Strata MCP to manage and automate multi-platform workflows including Slack and Gmail—all through simple natural language prompts.
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli) with **active credits** (required for API usage)
- A Klavis [AI account](https://www.klavis.ai/) with access to your Strata URL
- OAuth authentication completed in Klavis dashboard for Slack and Gmail (see [Klavis integrations guide](https://www.klavis.ai/integrations))

<Warning>
  To use agents in headless mode, you need a [Continue API key](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys).
  Klavis AI Strata requires proper OAuth authentication for each service integration.
</Warning>

For all options, first:
<Steps>
<Step title="Install Continue CLI">
  ```bash
  npm i -g @continuedev/cli
  ```
  </Step>

<Step title="Get Klavis AI's Strata URL">
  1. Visit [klavis.ai](https://www.klavis.ai/) and create an account
  2. Navigate to your dashboard and generate [Strata URL](https://www.klavis.ai/home/mcp-servers)
  3. Copy the Strata URL for configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Klavis AI Strata MCP Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an Agent on Continue Hub">
        Go to the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Klavis AI Strata MCP">
        Add the following YAML configuration to your agent:

        ```yaml title="config.yaml"
            name: klavis-strata
            version: 0.0.1
            schema: v1

            mcpServers:
              - name: klavis-strata
                command: npx
                args:
                  - "mcp-remote"
                  - "https://strata.klavis.ai/mcp/?strata_id=your_strata_id_here"
        ```

        **Notes:**
        - Keep your Klavis Strata URL secret and secure
        - Ensure your Klavis account has Slack and Gmail integrations activated
        - Complete OAuth flows for both Slack and Gmail in the Klavis dashboard
      </Step>

      <Step title="Test the Connection">
        Launch Continue and ask:
        ```
        Check my latest 5 emails and summarize them in a Slack message to #general.
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Pro tip**: Learn how to integrate and use [Klavis Strata](https://www.klavis.ai/docs/knowledge-base/use-mcp-server/continue) with Continue through CLI and IDE.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI Setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set Environment Variables">
        ```bash
        export KLAVIS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Launch Continue with Klavis MCP">
        From your project root:
        ```bash
        cn --agent your-agent-name
        ```
        Now try:
        ```
        "Send a Slack message to #general saying 'Hello from Continue!'"
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Agent Requirements">
  To use Klavis AI Strata MCP with Continue CLI, you need either:
  - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR
  - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Hub secrets

  The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration along with the Klavis AI Strata MCP for multi-tool operations.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">
    - **Klavis Strata URL not recognized**: Verify the Strata URL is active and correctly set in environment variables or Hub secrets
    - **Slack OAuth failed**: Re-authenticate through the Klavis AI dashboard and ensure workspace permissions are granted
    - **Gmail OAuth failed**: Check Google Cloud Console for API access and ensure the Gmail API is enabled
    - **Token expired**: Klavis AI manages token refresh automatically, but you may need to re-authorize if it fails
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Message Delivery Issues">
    - **Slack message not sent**: Verify the bot has permission to post in the target channel
    - **Gmail rate limiting**: Google imposes sending limits—monitor your quota
    - **Channel not found**: Check channel name spelling and ensure it's public or the bot has been invited
    - **User not found**: Verify Slack username format (@username) and that the user exists in the workspace
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow Execution Issues">
    - **Multi-step workflow incomplete**: Check each step individually to identify where the failure occurred
    - **Rate limits hit**: Klavis manages rate limiting, but external APIs (Slack, Gmail) have their own limits
    - **Permission denied errors**: Ensure your authenticated user has the necessary permissions for the requested operation
    - **Integration not available**: Verify the integration is active in your Klavis dashboard at klavis.ai/integrations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
