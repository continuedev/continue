<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="robot">

  A comprehensive project management workflow that lets you create, update, and
  manage Linear issues, projects, and team workflows from natural-language
  prompts. Automate sprint planning, bug triage, feature tracking, and status
  reporting – perfect for engineering teams using Linear for project management.

</Card>

## What You'll Learn

This cookbook teaches you to:

- Connect the [Linear MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/linear/linear-mcp) to Continue for seamless issue management
- Create and update Linear issues, projects, and cycles through AI prompts
- Automate project workflows including sprint planning and bug triage
- Generate status reports and project insights directly from your Linear workspace

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue CLI Setup">
    Install the Continue CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
    
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    cn --version
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    
      Need help with CLI setup? Check our [CLI guide](/guides/cli) for detailed instructions.
    
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Linear Account Requirements">
    - [Linear workspace](https://linear.app) with Member (or higher) access
    - Linear API key with appropriate permissions
    - Node.js 18+ installed locally
    - [Continue account](https://hub.continue.dev) with Hub access
    
    <Warning>
    
      **Agent usage requires credits** – create a Continue API key at
      [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
      and store it as a secret.
    
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Linear API Key">
    1. Go to **[Linear Settings > API](https://linear.app/settings/api)**
    2. Click **Create new API key**
    3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Continue MCP Integration")
    4. Select appropriate scopes (read/write access to issues, projects, teams)
    5. Copy the generated API key
    
    <Info>
    
      This token is your `LINEAR_API_KEY` secret.
      Store it securely – you won't be able to view it again.
    
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secrets to Continue Hub">
    1. Open **[Continue Hub Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)**
    2. Click **+ New Secret** and add:
       - **Key:** `LINEAR_API_KEY` → **Value:** `lin_api_...` (Your Linear API key)
       - **Key:** `CONTINUE_API_KEY` → **Value:** `cont_api_...` (Your Continue API key)
    
    <Tip>
    
      Continue's secure storage means secrets are available in any prompt as
      `$LINEAR_API_KEY` etc.
    
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>

  **Protect Your API Keys:**
  - Treat `LINEAR_API_KEY` like a password → rotate regularly
  - Use minimal required scopes for your use case
  - Store secrets in Continue Hub, never commit to git
  - Monitor API usage for unusual activity
  - Review team member access permissions regularly

</Warning>
