---

<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="code-pull-request">
  An automated pull request review system that:
  - Reviews code automatically when pull requests open or update
  - Applies your team's custom rules and standards
  - Runs in your GitHub Actions runner (code is sent directly to your configured LLM)
  - Posts actionable feedback as pull request comments
  - Responds to interactive review requests
</Card>

## Why This Approach?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Privacy-First" icon="shield">
    All logs and processing happen in your runner: Continue CLI runs in GitHub Actions → code to your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). No hosted Continue service reads your code.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Customizable" icon="sliders">
    Define team-specific rules in `.continue/rules/` that automatically apply to every pull request.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Context Awareness" icon="robot">
    Leverage Continue's AI agent for intelligent, context-aware reviews with full control over your configuration.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A GitHub repository with pull requests
- Continue account with **Hub access**
  - Read: [Understanding Configs](/guides/understanding-configs)
- A Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
- Continue assistant configured for code reviews (or use our recommended default)

## Quick Setup (10 Minutes)

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure Repository Secrets and Variables">

    Navigate to your repository settings: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

    **Required Secrets:**
    - `CONTINUE_API_KEY` - Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)

    **Optional (for better permissions):**
    - **Variables** tab: `APP_ID` - GitHub App ID (for enhanced API rate limits)
    - **Secrets** tab: `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - GitHub App private key

    <Accordion title="Setting up a GitHub App (Optional but Recommended)">

      For better rate limits and permissions, create a GitHub App:

      1. Go to Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App
      2. Set permissions:
          - **Contents**: Read
          - **Pull Requests**: Write
          - **Issues**: Write
      3. Generate a private key
      4. Install the app on your repository
      5. Add `APP_ID` as a repository **variable** (Variables tab)
      6. Add `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as a repository **secret** (Secrets tab)

      Without a GitHub App, the action will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

    </Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Workflow File">

    Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` with the provided configuration.

```yaml
name: Continue Code Review

</Step >

<Step title="Create Custom Rules (Optional)" >

Define your team's standards in `.continue/rules/`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Security Rule">
    
 Create `.continue/rules/security.md`:

```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py}"
description: "Security Review Standards"
alwaysApply: true
---

# Security Checklist

- No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL queries use parameterization (no string concatenation)
- Authentication and authorization checks are in place
- Sensitive data is properly encrypted
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript Standards">
    Create `.continue/rules/typescript.md`:

```markdown
  ---
  globs: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  description: "TypeScript Best Practices"
  ---

  # TypeScript Standards

  - Use strict type checking (avoid `any` types)
  - Prefer interfaces for object shapes
  - Use proper error handling with typed errors
  - Document complex types with JSDoc comments
  - Export types for public APIs
  - Use const assertions where appropriate
```
</Tab >
<Tab title="Testing Standards">
Create `.continue/rules/testing.md`:

```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
description: "Testing Requirements"
---

# Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Test both happy paths and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain intent
- Keep tests focused and isolated (no shared state)
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for meaningful assertions, not coverage metrics
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python Standards">
Create `.continue/rules/python.md`:

```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.py"
description: "Python Code Standards"
---

# Python Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for public functions/classes
- Use context managers for resource management
- Prefer list comprehensions for simple transformations
- Handle exceptions explicitly, avoid bare except
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
</Steps>
## How It Works

The workflow follows these steps:

1. **Pull Request Created/Updated** - A pull request is opened or synchronized
2. **Workflow Triggered** - GitHub Actions workflow starts automatically
3. **Load Custom Rules** - Reads your team's rules from `.continue/rules/`
4. **Get Pull Request Diff** - Fetches the diff and list of changed files
5. **Continue CLI Analyzes Code** - AI agent reviews the code with your rules
6. **Post or Update Review Comment** - Creates or updates a single PR comment with feedback

## Interactive Commands

Comment on any pull request to trigger focused reviews:

```
@review-bot check for security issues
@review-bot review the TypeScript types
@review-bot explain the architecture changes
@review-bot focus on error handling
```

The workflow will respond with a targeted review based on your request.

## Advanced Configuration
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Your Own Continue Config">
    
  By default, the workflow uses the `continuedev/code-reviewer` config optimized for code reviews. Replace `continuedev/code-reviewer` with your own config:

  ```yaml
  - name: Run Continue Review
    env:
      CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
      CONTINUE_ORG: your-org-name      # Add your org
      CONTINUE_CONFIG: username/config-name  # Add your config
    run: |
      cn --config $CONTINUE_ORG/$CONTINUE_CONFIG \
        -p "$PROMPT" \
        --auto > review_output.md
  ```

  Store `CONTINUE_ORG` and `CONTINUE_CONFIG` as repository variables for easy updates.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Filter by File Types">

  Only review specific file types in pull requests:

  ```yaml
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
      paths:
        - '**.ts'
        - '**.tsx'
        - '**.py'
        - '**.go'
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Review Size Limits">

  Skip large pull requests that would be expensive to review:

  ```yaml
  - name: Check PR Size
    id: size-check
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token || github.token }}
    run: |
      ADDITIONS=$(gh pr view ${{ steps.pr.outputs.pr_number }} --json additions -q .additions)
      DELETIONS=$(gh pr view ${{ steps.pr.outputs.pr_number }} --json deletions -q .deletions)
      TOTAL=$((ADDITIONS + DELETIONS))
      
      if [ $TOTAL -gt 1000 ]; then
        echo "skip=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo "⚠️  Pull request too large for automatic review ($TOTAL lines changed)"
      else
        echo "skip=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      fi

  - name: Run Continue Review
    if: steps.size-check.outputs.skip != 'true'
    # ... rest of review step
  ```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
## Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Continue CLI not found">
- The workflow installs the CLI automatically, but ensure Node.js 20+ is available
- Check the "Install Continue CLI" step logs for errors
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed">
- Verify your `CONTINUE_API_KEY` is valid
- Check that GitHub token has required permissions
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No review generated">
- Verify your Continue config is accessible
- Check Continue CLI logs in the workflow run
- Try running locally: `cn -p "Test prompt" --auto`
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Review comment not posted">
- Ensure `pull-requests: write` permission is set
- Verify GitHub token has scope to comment on pull requests
- Check if the repository requires signed commits
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Example Output

Here's what a typical review comment looks like:

> ## 🤖 AI Code Review
>
> ### Summary
> This pull request introduces a new user authentication system with JWT tokens and password hashing. The implementation follows security best practices with a few minor suggestions.
>
> ### Key Findings
>
> **Security** ✅
> - Password hashing properly implemented with bcrypt
> - JWT tokens include appropriate expiry
> - Input validation present for all endpoints
>
> **Code Quality** 💡
> - Consider adding rate limiting to login endpoint
> - The `secretKey` should be loaded from environment variables, not hardcoded
> - Add unit tests for token expiration edge cases
>
> ### Positive Observations
> - Good separation of concerns with middleware pattern
> - Clear error messages for authentication failures
> - Proper async/await usage throughout
>
> ### Recommendations
> 1. Move `secretKey` to environment variables (see `.continue/rules/security.md`)
> 2. Add rate limiting middleware to prevent brute force attacks
> 3. Consider adding integration tests for the auth flow
> 4. Document the JWT payload structure
