<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="notion">

  A workflow that lets you query, update, and create Notion pages or database
  entries from natural-language prompts. Generate PRDs, sprint tasks, meeting
  notes, or status reports automatically – perfect for individual developers
  and cross-functional teams.

</Card>

## What You'll Learn

This guide teaches you to:
- Use natural language to connect to the Notion API directly with Continue CLI for powerful automation
- Configure Notion API access with proper permissions and security
- Run prompts in both TUI (interactive) and headless modes
- Create automated workflows that generate docs, manage tasks, and sync data

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/cli/overview) installed (`npm i -g @continuedev/cli`)
- A [Notion workspace](https://notion.so) with Editor (or higher) access
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue account](https://hub.continue.dev) with **Hub access**

<Warning>

  **Agent usage requires credits** – create a Continue API key at
  [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
  and store it as a secret.

</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    cn --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Notion Integration & Get API Key">
    1. Go to **[Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)**
    2. Click **+ New integration** → give it a name (e.g. "Continue Integration")
    3. Select your workspace
    4. Under **Content Capabilities**, enable:
       - ✅ Read content
       - ✅ Update content
       - ✅ Insert content
    5. Under **Comment Capabilities**, enable:
       - ✅ Read comments
       - ✅ Insert comments
    6. Under **User Capabilities**, select:
       - ✅ Read user information including email addresses
    7. Click **Submit** and copy the **Internal Integration Secret** (starts with `secret_`)

    <Info>

      This token is your `NOTION_API_KEY`.
      Keep it safe – you won't be able to view it again.

    </Info>

    8. In Notion, open each database or top-level page you want accessible → **Share** → **Invite** your new integration → **Full access**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API Access">
    Set your Notion API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    export NOTION_API_KEY="secret_xxx"
    ```

    <Tip>

    Running this command sets your API key for the current terminal session only.  
    When you close the terminal, the variable won't persist. To test your API key, run the curl command below in the same session.

     ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_KEY" \
         -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
         https://api.notion.com/v1/databases
    ```
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Workspace Keys to Terminal Session">
    Depending on what you want `cn` to accomplish, you'll need to add your Notion workspace keys to the terminal session. The workspace key is your Notion database ID. Run the following command:

      ```bash
      export NOTION_DATABASE_ID="your_database_id"
      ```
    <Tip>

     You can find your database ID by:
        1. Opening your Notion changelog database
        2. Looking at the URL - it will be something like:
        https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...
        3. The DATABASE_ID is the long string of characters between the last / and the ?

    </Tip>

## Running Continue AI Agent with Notion API

<Card title="🚀 Choose Your Interface" icon="zap">

  Continue CLI offers two powerful modes for Notion automation:
  **TUI mode** for interactive workflows and **Headless mode** for automated scripts.

</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🖥️ TUI Mode (Interactive)">

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Launch Interactive Mode">
        Navigate to your project directory and run:
        ```bash
        cn 
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Your First Prompt">
        In the TUI interface, enter:
        ```
        1. Fetch my Notion databases using the Notion API key
        and Database ID stored in this terminal session.
        2. Look at the last week of Merged GitHub PRs, and create
        a changelog entry in Notion summarizing the features and breaking changes.
        ```

        <Tip>

          TUI mode lets you review and approve each action before execution,
          perfect for learning and debugging.

        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🤖 Headless Mode (Automated)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run Automated Commands">
        Execute prompts directly from the command line:
        ```bash
        cn -p --auto "
        1. Fetch my Notion databases using the Notion API key
        and Database ID stored in this terminal session.
        2. Analyze all merged GitHub PRs from the past week.
        3. Extract feature descriptions and breaking changes.
        4. Create a technical changelog in Notion with PR links."
        ```

        **Flags explained:**
        - `-p`: Run without TUI interface
        - `--auto`: Execute without manual approval

        <Warning>

          Always test prompts in TUI mode first before running
          them with `--auto` in production.

        </Warning>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="API Connection Notes">

  - Environment variable `NOTION_API_KEY` must be set before running Continue CLI
  - Continue automatically uses the API key to authenticate with Notion
  - No need for manual curl commands - just reference "the API key stored in this session"
  - For complex workflows, Continue maintains the API connection throughout
  - Consider creating aliases or scripts for frequently used prompts

</Accordion>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>

  **Protect Your API Keys:**
  - Never commit `NOTION_API_KEY` to version control
  - Use environment variables or secure secret managers
  - Rotate API keys every 90 days
  - Grant integration access only to required databases/pages
  - Monitor API usage through Notion's integration dashboard
  - Use `.env` files with `.gitignore` for local development

</Warning>


## Next Steps

- Create a **GitHub Actions** workflow to automate changelog generation on releases
- Build a **daily standup bot** that runs every morning and posts to Slack
- Set up **database templates** in Notion for consistent formatting
- Explore **batch operations** to update multiple pages efficiently
- Implement **error handling** for API rate limits and network issues

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues and Solutions">

  **API Key Not Found:**
  - Ensure `NOTION_API_KEY` is exported in your current shell session
  - Check for typos in the environment variable name
  - Verify the key starts with `secret_`

  **Database Access Denied:**
  - Share the specific database with your integration in Notion
  - Ensure the integration has the correct permissions (Read, Write, Insert)

  **Connection Issues:**
  - Verify Continue CLI has internet access
  - Check network connectivity to api.notion.com
  - Ensure your Notion workspace allows API access

  **Rate Limiting:**
  - Notion API has rate limits (3 requests per second)
  - Implement exponential backoff for automated scripts
  - Consider batching operations when possible
