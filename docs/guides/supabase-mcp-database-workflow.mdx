<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="shield-check">
  A security audit workflow that uses Continue CLI with Supabase MCP to identify RLS vulnerabilities, generate secure policies, fix permission issues, and ensure your database follows security best practices.
</Card>

## What You'll Learn

This cookbook teaches you to:

- Use [Supabase MCP](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp) to audit database security
- Identify tables without Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Find and fix overly permissive or missing RLS policies
- Generate secure RLS migrations following best practices
- Automate security audits with GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Supabase account](https://supabase.com) with an active project
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli) with **active credits** (required for API usage)
- Basic understanding of SQL and database concepts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Continue CLI Account & API Key">
    1. Visit [Continue Organizations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations)
    2. Sign up or log in to your Continue account
    3. Navigate to your organization settings
    4. Click **"API Keys"** and then **"+ New API Key"**
    5. Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again!)
    6. Login to the CLI: `cn login`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Continue CLI can analyze your database schema and generate complex SQL queries - you just need to describe what you want in plain language!
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials

First, you'll need to set up access to your Supabase project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configure Supabase MCP">

    <Warning>
      **Security First**: Follow [Supabase's security best practices](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#security-risks) when using MCP:
      - Never connect to production databases directly
      - Use development or staging environments
      - Enable read-only mode when possible
      - Scope MCP access to specific projects
    </Warning>

    The Supabase MCP supports OAuth authentication for secure access:

    **OAuth Configuration (Recommended)**

    The Supabase MCP will prompt for OAuth authentication when first used. Simply follow the authorization flow.

    **Remote MCP URL**
    ```
    https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp
    ```

    <Info>
      The MCP server can be scoped to a specific project for better security. Configure this during setup.
    </Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Supabase Project Setup">
    To use Supabase MCP effectively, ensure your project has:

    1. **Development Environment** - Create a separate development project:
       - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
       - Create a new project for development/testing
       - Copy the project URL and anon key

    2. **Database Schema** - Set up some initial tables for testing:
       ```sql
       -- Example schema for testing
       CREATE TABLE users (
         id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
         email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
       );

       CREATE TABLE posts (
         id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
         title TEXT NOT NULL,
         content TEXT,
         published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
         created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
       );
       ```

    3. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Enable RLS for security:
       ```sql
       ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
       ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
       ```

    <Tip>
      Use [Supabase Branching](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/branching) to create isolated development branches for safe testing.

</Warning>

## Step 2: Analyze Your Database with AI

Use Continue CLI to perform intelligent database analysis. Enter these prompts in the Continue CLI TUI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Schema Analysis">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Analyze my Supabase database schema and provide:
    - Complete table structure with data types
    - Relationships between tables
    - Missing indexes that could improve performance
    - Unused or redundant columns
    - Suggestions for normalization improvements
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RLS Security Audit">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Perform a comprehensive RLS (Row Level Security) audit on my Supabase database:
    
    For each table:
    - Check if RLS is enabled
    - List all existing RLS policies
    - Identify tables without any RLS policies (security risk)
    - Find overly permissive policies (e.g., allowing all operations)
    - Suggest missing policies based on common patterns
    - Generate SQL to fix identified security issues
    
    Prioritize findings by risk level:
    1. Critical: Tables with sensitive data but no RLS
    2. High: Overly permissive policies
    3. Medium: Missing common policies (e.g., users can only see own data)
    4. Low: Policy optimization opportunities
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Fix RLS Policies">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Based on the RLS audit, generate SQL migrations to fix all security issues:
    
    1. Enable RLS on all tables that don't have it:
       - Include ALTER TABLE statements
       - Add comment explaining why RLS is needed
    
    2. Create secure default policies for common patterns:
       - Users can only read/update their own records
       - Admins have full access (with role checking)
       - Public read-only access where appropriate
       - Proper INSERT policies for new records
    
    3. Fix overly permissive policies:
       - Replace 'true' conditions with proper checks
       - Add user_id or role-based restrictions
       - Include USING clauses for read operations
       - Include WITH CHECK clauses for write operations
    
    4. For each policy, include:
       - Clear naming convention (e.g., 'users_select_own')
       - Comments explaining the security model
       - Rollback statements
    
    Generate the complete migration file with all fixes.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Available Supabase MCP Capabilities**:
  - **Database Queries**: Execute SQL queries and analyze results
  - **Schema Inspection**: View table structures, relationships, and constraints
  - **Performance Analysis**: Identify slow queries and optimization opportunities
  - **Security Review**: Check RLS policies and access controls
  - **Migration Generation**: Create SQL migrations for schema changes
</Info>

## Step 3: Generate Database Migrations

Create and apply database migrations based on AI recommendations. Enter this prompt in the Continue CLI TUI:

**Example: Complete RLS Security Fix**

```
I need to secure my Supabase database. Please:

1. First, audit all tables for RLS security issues
2. Generate a complete migration to fix all issues found
3. Create a security report I can share with my team

Here's what I need fixed:
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Create policies so users can only access their own data
- Ensure admins (role = 'admin') have full access
- Add policies for service accounts (role = 'service')
- Include audit logging for sensitive operations

For the users table specifically:
- Users can read their own profile
- Users can update their own profile (except role field)
- Only admins can view all users
- Only admins can delete users
- New users can insert their own record during signup

Generate the complete migration with:
- All SQL statements
- Clear policy names and comments
- Rollback statements
- A summary of what each policy does
```

**Expected Output:**
The AI will generate a complete SQL migration file that:
- Enables RLS on all tables
- Creates secure, well-documented policies
- Follows Supabase security best practices
- Includes rollback capabilities
- Provides a security summary for your team

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Always review AI-generated migrations before applying them. Test in a development branch first using Supabase's branching feature.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Set Up Automated Database Monitoring

  schedule:
    # Run daily at 2 AM UTC
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers

jobs:
  monitor-database:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22"

      - name: Install Continue CLI
        run: |
          npm install -g @continuedev/cli
          echo "✅ Continue CLI installed"

      - name: Analyze Database Security
        env:
          CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Performing security audit..."
          
          # Use Continue CLI to audit RLS and generate fixes
          cn -p "Using Supabase MCP, perform a comprehensive RLS security audit:
                 1. Check all tables for RLS enablement
                 2. Identify tables with missing or weak RLS policies
                 3. Find overly permissive policies (e.g., 'true' conditions)
                 4. Check for common security anti-patterns:
                    - Missing user_id checks
                    - No role-based access control
                    - Unrestricted DELETE operations
                    - Missing WITH CHECK clauses
                 5. Generate fixes for all security issues found
                 6. Create a security report with:
                    - Critical vulnerabilities (tables without RLS)
                    - High-risk policies that need immediate fixes
                    - SQL migrations to fix all issues
                    - Best practice recommendations
                    - Compliance checklist (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
                 
                 If critical security issues are found:
                 - Generate the complete fix migration
                 - Create a GitHub issue with severity labels
                 - Tag security team members for review"

      - name: Save Health Report
        run: |
          echo "## 📊 Database Health Report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "Generated at $(date)" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "Check the 'Analyze Database Security' step for the full report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

      - name: Upload Health Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
