</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials

First, you'll need to set up access to your Supabase project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configure Supabase MCP">

    <Warning>
      **Security First**: Follow [Supabase's security best practices](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#security-risks) when using MCP:
      - Never connect to production databases directly
      - Use development or staging environments
      - Enable read-only mode when possible
      - Scope MCP access to specific projects
    </Warning>

    The Supabase MCP supports OAuth authentication for secure access:

    **OAuth Configuration (Recommended)**

    The Supabase MCP will prompt for OAuth authentication when first used. Simply follow the authorization flow.

    **Remote MCP URL**
    ```
    https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp
    ```

    <Info>
      The MCP server can be scoped to a specific project for better security. Configure this during setup.
    </Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Supabase Project Setup">
    To use Supabase MCP effectively, ensure your project has:

    1. **Development Environment** - Create a separate development project:
       - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
       - Create a new project for development/testing
       - Copy the project URL and anon key

    2. **Database Schema** - Set up some initial tables for testing:
       ```sql
       -- Example schema for testing
       CREATE TABLE users (
         id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
         email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
       );

       CREATE TABLE posts (
         id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
         title TEXT NOT NULL,
         content TEXT,
         published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
         created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
       );
       ```

    3. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Enable RLS for security:
       ```sql
       ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
       ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
       ```

    <Tip>
      Use [Supabase Branching](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/branching) to create isolated development branches for safe testing.
