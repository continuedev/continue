## Performance Analysis Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to analyze web performance. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Chrome DevTools MCP tools.

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt"` for headless commands

  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running performance measurements, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes). This shows you what the agent will do without executing it.
</Info>

### Step 1: Baseline Performance Trace

Establish your current performance baseline:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and record a performance trace with page reload. Analyze the trace and show me the LCP, FID, CLS, and total blocking time.
```


<Info>

    Chrome DevTools Performance Panel automatically tracks:
    - **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS, INP
    - **Loading Performance**: DOMContentLoaded, Load events, First Paint
    - **Runtime Performance**: JavaScript execution time, layout shifts, paint events
    - **Resource Usage**: Memory consumption, CPU utilization

</Info>

### Step 2: Analyze Performance Insights

Deep dive into specific performance issues:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Record a performance trace for http://localhost:3000 and analyze all Performance Insights. For each insight found, provide detailed information about:
- The specific issue (e.g., DocumentLatency, SlowCSS)
- Root cause analysis
- Affected resources or code
- Recommended optimizations
- Expected impact on Core Web Vitals
```

<Info>
  **Performance Insights**: Chrome DevTools automatically detects common performance issues like:
  - **Render Blocking Resources**: CSS and JavaScript that delay first paint
  - **Layout Shifts**: Elements that move during page load
  - **Long Tasks**: JavaScript execution blocking the main thread
  - **Slow Network Requests**: Resources taking too long to load
  - **Unused CSS/JavaScript**: Dead code increasing bundle size
</Info>

### Step 3: Network Performance Analysis

Identify slow network requests and optimization opportunities:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Navigate to https://my-site.com and:
1. List all network requests made during page load
2. Identify the 5 slowest requests and their sizes
3. Find any requests over 1MB
4. Detect render-blocking resources
5. Check for inefficient caching (missing cache headers)
6. Suggest specific optimizations for each issue found
```

### Step 4: Throttling Performance Tests

Test performance under real-world network and CPU conditions:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Test my site's performance under different conditions:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Emulate 4x CPU slowdown and Fast 3G network
3. Record a performance trace with reload
4. Analyze LCP and Total Blocking Time
5. Take a screenshot when page is fully loaded

Then repeat the test with:
- Slow 3G network + 6x CPU slowdown
- Offline network (to test service worker)

Compare results and identify which conditions cause the worst performance degradation."
```

<Info>
  **Available Network Presets**:
  - No throttling
  - Fast 3G (1.6 Mbps down, 0.75 Mbps up)
  - Slow 3G (400 Kbps down, 400 Kbps up)
  - Offline

  **CPU Throttling**: 4x, 6x, or custom slowdown to simulate low-end devices
</Info>

### Step 5: JavaScript Performance Analysis

Identify expensive JavaScript operations:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Record a performance trace for http://localhost:3000 and:
1. Identify all long tasks (>50ms) blocking the main thread
2. Find the specific JavaScript functions causing these tasks
3. Measure total JavaScript execution time
4. Detect unused JavaScript being loaded
5. Show the call stack for the longest task
6. Recommend code splitting or lazy loading opportunities"
```

## Automated Performance Monitoring

### Step 6: Core Web Vitals Dashboard

Create automated monitoring for Core Web Vitals:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Create a performance monitoring script that:
1. Opens my site at http://localhost:3000
2. Records a performance trace with reload
3. Extracts Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, INP)
4. Checks console for JavaScript errors
5. Takes a screenshot
6. Saves results to performance-report.json with format:
   {
     'timestamp': 'ISO date',
     'lcp': number,
     'fid': number,
     'cls': number,
     'inp': number,
     'errors': array,
     'screenshot': 'path'
   }

Save this as scripts/performance-monitor.js that I can run regularly"
```

### Step 7: Visual Regression Detection

Detect unintended visual changes:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Set up visual regression testing:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Take full-page screenshots at:
   - Desktop viewport (1920x1080)
   - Tablet viewport (768x1024)
   - Mobile viewport (375x667)
3. Save screenshots to screenshots/baseline/
4. Create a script to compare future screenshots against baseline
5. Highlight any pixel differences over 5%
6. Generate a visual diff report"
```

### Step 8: Performance Budget Enforcement

Set and enforce performance budgets:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Create a performance budget checker that:

Requirements:
- LCP must be < 2.5 seconds
- FID must be < 100ms
- CLS must be < 0.1
- Total JavaScript < 300KB
- Total page size < 1MB
- No console errors

Implementation:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Record performance trace with reload
3. List all network requests and calculate total sizes
4. Check console messages for errors
5. Validate all metrics against budgets
6. Exit with code 1 if any budget is exceeded
7. Generate a detailed report showing pass/fail for each metric

Save as scripts/performance-budget.js for CI/CD integration"
```

## Continuous Performance Testing with GitHub Actions

This example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where performance validation runs automatically in your CI/CD pipeline using Chrome DevTools MCP in headless mode.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)

### Create Workflow File

This workflow automatically validates web performance on pull requests using the Continue CLI in headless mode. It records performance traces, extracts Core Web Vitals, and posts a summary report as a PR comment.

Create `.github/workflows/performance-check.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Performance Check

## Advanced Performance Workflows

### Step 9: Competitor Comparison

Compare your site's performance with competitors:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Compare performance between my site and competitors:

Sites to test:
- http://localhost:3000 (my site)
- https://competitor1.com
- https://competitor2.com

For each site:
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Record performance trace with reload
3. Extract LCP, FID, CLS, Total Blocking Time
4. List network requests and calculate total page size
5. Count JavaScript and CSS files

Create a comparison table showing:
- Site name
- All Core Web Vitals
- Total page size
- Number of requests
- Which site performs best for each metric

Provide specific recommendations for how my site can improve based on what competitors do better."
```

### Step 10: Performance Testing Across Routes

Test performance consistency across your entire site:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Test performance across all major routes:

Routes to test:
- / (homepage)
- /products
- /products/[id] (pick a sample product)
- /checkout
- /blog

For each route:
1. Navigate to the URL
2. Record performance trace
3. Extract LCP, Total Blocking Time, bundle size
4. Check console for errors
5. Take a screenshot

Generate a report showing:
- Which routes have the worst LCP
- Routes with the most JavaScript errors
- Bundle size variations across routes
- Recommendations for route-specific optimizations"
```

### Step 11: Mobile Performance Analysis

Focus on mobile-specific performance issues:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Analyze mobile performance for http://localhost:3000:

1. Resize viewport to mobile (375x667)
2. Emulate Slow 3G network + 4x CPU slowdown
3. Record performance trace with reload
4. Analyze Performance Insights for mobile-specific issues
5. Check for:
   - Touch target sizes too small
   - Horizontal scrolling issues
   - Oversized images not optimized for mobile
   - Excessive JavaScript on mobile
6. Take mobile screenshot
7. Provide mobile-specific optimization recommendations"
```

## Performance Troubleshooting

### Debug Performance Regressions

Quickly identify what caused a performance regression:

**TUI Mode Prompt:**
```
Debug performance regression on http://localhost:3000:

1. Record performance trace
2. Analyze all Performance Insights
3. List console errors and warnings
4. Check network requests for:
   - Failed requests
   - Slow requests (>1s)
   - Large requests (>500KB)
5. Identify the top 3 performance bottlenecks
6. For each bottleneck, suggest:
   - Root cause
   - Specific code or resource causing it
   - Step-by-step fix
   - Expected performance improvement"
```

### Performance Issue Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix Command (in cn TUI) |
| :---- | :---------------------------- |
| Slow LCP | `"Find render-blocking resources and suggest preloading or deferring"` |
| High CLS | `"Detect layout shifts and identify unsized images or dynamic content"` |
| Long Tasks | `"Find JavaScript tasks over 50ms and suggest code splitting"` |
| Large Bundles | `"List all JavaScript files, identify largest ones, suggest lazy loading"` |
| Slow Network | `"Find requests over 500KB and suggest compression or optimization"` |
| Console Errors | `"List all console errors and suggest fixes"` |
