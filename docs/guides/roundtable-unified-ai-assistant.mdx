# Roundtable MCP: Unified AI Workflow

Build an intelligent AI routing system that automatically selects the optimal AI model for each coding task using Continue CLI and Roundtable MCP Server.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a unified AI workflow that:

- **Automatically routes coding tasks** to the most appropriate AI model (Claude for architecture, GPT-4 for creative tasks, etc.)
- **Maintains conversation context** across different AI providers seamlessly
- **Optimizes cost and performance** by using the right model for each task type
- **Integrates natively with Continue CLI** for streamlined development workflows
- **Provides zero-configuration setup** with intelligent defaults for immediate productivity

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Continue CLI installed** ([installation guide](https://continue.dev/docs/quickstart))
- **Node.js 18+** for package management
- **API keys** for your preferred AI providers:
  - Anthropic API key (for Claude)
  - OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
  - Google API key (for Gemini, optional)

## Quick Start vs Manual Setup

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Quick Start">

Get up and running with Roundtable MCP in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Install Roundtable MCP Server
npm install -g roundtable-ai

# Initialize with Continue CLI
continue mcp add roundtable

# Configure your API keys
continue config set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY your_claude_key_here
continue config set OPENAI_API_KEY your_openai_key_here

# Start using intelligent routing
continue chat "Route this to the best model for code review"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manual Setup">

For custom configurations and advanced setups:

1. **Install the MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g roundtable-ai
   ```

2. **Configure Continue MCP Settings**:
   ```bash
   continue config edit
   ```

3. **Add Roundtable to your Continue configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "roundtable": {
         "command": "roundtable-mcp",
         "args": ["--port", "3000"],
         "env": {
           "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_claude_key_here",
           "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Continue** to load the new MCP server:
   ```bash
   continue restart
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Workflow Implementation

### Step 1: Verify MCP Integration

Confirm Roundtable is properly integrated with Continue:

```bash
# Check MCP server status
continue mcp status

# Test the connection
continue chat "@roundtable health check"
```

### Step 2: Configure Intelligent Routing

Set up routing rules based on your development needs:

```bash
# Configure routing preferences
continue chat "@roundtable configure routing rules for:
- Code review -> Claude
- Quick completions -> GPT-3.5-turbo
- Architecture discussions -> Claude
- Creative naming -> GPT-4"
```

### Step 3: Enable Workflow Automation

Integrate routing into your Continue CLI workflow:

```bash
# Automatic routing based on task type
continue edit --route-optimal "refactor this function for better performance"

# Context-aware conversations
continue chat --continue-context "@roundtable discuss database optimization strategies"

# Project-specific routing
continue workspace configure --mcp-routing roundtable
```

## Advanced Continue CLI Integration

### Intelligent Code Review Workflow

```bash
# Route code review to specialized models
continue review --route "@roundtable analyze this PR for:
- Security vulnerabilities -> Claude
- Performance issues -> GPT-4
- Code style -> CodeLlama"
```

### Multi-Model Architecture Discussions

```bash
# Long-form architectural conversations
continue chat --session architecture "@roundtable
Let's design a microservices architecture.
Route complex design questions to Claude and
implementation details to GPT-4."
```

### Automated Task Routing

```bash
# Set up automatic routing based on file types
continue config set routing.rules '{
  "*.test.js": "claude",
  "*.md": "gpt-4",
  "*.py": "claude",
  "architecture/*": "claude"
}'
```

## What You've Built

Your AI workflow now features:

- **Intelligent Task Routing**: Automatically selects Claude for complex architectural decisions, GPT-4 for creative tasks, and faster models for simple completions
- **Seamless Continue Integration**: Works natively with `continue chat`, `continue edit`, and `continue review` commands
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation history across different AI models within Continue sessions
- **Cost-Optimized Operations**: Uses appropriate models for each task type, reducing API costs while maximizing effectiveness
- **Zero-Configuration Intelligence**: Learns from your patterns and automatically improves routing decisions

This system positions you in the **"Intelligent AI Orchestration"** tier of the Continuous AI maturity model - where AI selection becomes automatic and context-aware.

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management with Continue

```bash
# Store keys securely using Continue's built-in secrets management
continue secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
continue secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify secure storage
continue secrets list
```

### Conversation Privacy

```bash
# Enable conversation encryption
continue config set encryption.enabled true

# Set retention policies
continue config set conversation.retention 30days
```

## Advanced Prompts for Continue CLI

### Code Architecture Review
```bash
continue chat "@roundtable analyze this codebase architecture and route specialized questions:
- Database design decisions to Claude
- Performance optimization to GPT-4
- Security review to specialized security model"
```

### Multi-Language Development
```bash
continue workspace analyze --route-by-language "@roundtable
Route Python questions to Claude,
JavaScript to GPT-4, and
DevOps questions to appropriate specialists"
```

### Team Collaboration Workflows
```bash
continue team configure --shared-routing "@roundtable
Set up team-wide routing rules:
- Junior dev questions -> patient, detailed responses
- Senior dev questions -> concise, technical responses
- Architecture decisions -> Claude with full context"
```

## Next Steps

Expand your intelligent AI workflow:

1. **Explore Continue Extensions**: Add domain-specific routing for your tech stack
2. **Team Standardization**: Share routing configurations across your development team
3. **Custom Model Integration**: Add specialized models for your specific domain (DevOps, ML, etc.)
4. **Workflow Automation**: Integrate with Continue's task automation features
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Use Continue's analytics to optimize routing decisions
