# Roundtable MCP Server - Unified AI Assistant Management

The [Roundtable MCP Server](https://github.com/InsightFactory/roundtable) provides a unified interface for managing multiple AI assistants and routing conversations intelligently within your Continue workflow. This integration enables seamless switching between different AI models and conversation contexts while maintaining conversation history and context.

## Overview

Roundtable acts as a meta-assistant that orchestrates conversations across multiple AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) and provides intelligent conversation routing based on task complexity, model capabilities, and user preferences. When integrated with Continue, it enhances your coding workflow by:

- **Unified AI Access**: Single interface to multiple AI assistants
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic model selection based on task type
- **Conversation Management**: Seamless context switching and history
- **Zero Configuration**: Ready-to-use with sensible defaults
- **Continue Integration**: Works seamlessly with Continue's agent mode

## Why Use Roundtable with Continue?

Continue's powerful agent mode becomes even more effective when combined with Roundtable's unified AI management:

1. **Enhanced Model Selection**: Automatically route coding tasks to the most appropriate AI model
2. **Workflow Optimization**: Maintain conversation context across different AI assistants
3. **Development Efficiency**: Reduce cognitive overhead of manually switching between AI tools
4. **Consistent Experience**: Unified interface regardless of underlying AI provider

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Continue configured with agent mode
- API keys for desired AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. Install Roundtable MCP Server:

```bash
npm install -g @insightfactory/roundtable-mcp
```

2. Create a `.continue/mcpServers` folder in your workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p .continue/mcpServers
```

3. Create `roundtable.yaml` in the mcpServers folder:

```yaml title=".continue/mcpServers/roundtable.yaml"
name: Roundtable Unified AI Assistant
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: Roundtable
    command: roundtable-mcp
    args:
      - --port
      - "3000"
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      GOOGLE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}
```

### Configuration

Configure your AI provider credentials in your environment or Continue's secret management:

```bash
# Add to your .env file
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic AI Assistant Management

Once configured, you can use Roundtable through Continue's agent mode:

```
@roundtable route this conversation to the best model for code review
```

### Intelligent Task Routing

Roundtable automatically selects the appropriate AI model based on your request:

```
# Complex architectural question -> Routes to Claude
"Help me design a microservices architecture for this e-commerce platform"

# Quick code completion -> Routes to faster model
"Complete this function signature"

# Creative naming -> Routes to GPT-4
"Suggest creative variable names for this machine learning pipeline"
```

### Conversation Context Management

Maintain conversation history across different AI models:

```
@roundtable continue the previous conversation about database optimization with the architecture specialist
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Routing Rules

Configure custom routing rules based on your preferences:

```yaml title=".continue/mcpServers/roundtable.yaml"
name: Roundtable Unified AI Assistant
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: Roundtable
    command: roundtable-mcp
    args:
      - --config
      - "/path/to/roundtable-config.json"
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Integration with Continue's Features

Roundtable works seamlessly with Continue's existing features:

- **Agent Mode**: Enhanced with multi-model routing
- **Chat**: Unified conversation interface
- **Edit**: Model selection based on edit complexity
- **Autocomplete**: Intelligent provider switching

## Benefits for Development Teams

### Enhanced Productivity

- **Reduced Context Switching**: Stay in Continue while accessing multiple AI assistants
- **Optimal Model Selection**: Always use the right AI for the task
- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain context across sessions and models

### Cost Optimization

- **Smart Routing**: Use cost-effective models for simple tasks
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which models are most effective for different tasks
- **Budget Management**: Set usage limits and preferences per model

### Team Collaboration

- **Shared Configurations**: Team-wide routing rules and preferences
- **Conversation History**: Shareable conversation contexts
- **Model Performance**: Team insights into model effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Verify installation
   npm list -g @insightfactory/roundtable-mcp

   # Check logs
   tail -f ~/.continue/logs/roundtable.log
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables
   echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Routing Not Working**
   - Ensure agent mode is enabled in Continue
   - Check that MCP server is properly configured
   - Verify network connectivity
