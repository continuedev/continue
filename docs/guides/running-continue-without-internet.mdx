title: "Running Continue without Internet"
description: "Continue can be run even on an air-gapped computer if you use a local model. Only a few adjustments are required for this to work."

1. Download the latest .vsix file from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Continue/continue) and [install it to VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix).
2. Open the [User Settings Page](/customize/settings) and turn off "Allow Anonymous Telemetry". This will stop Continue from attempting requests to PostHog for [anonymous telemetry](/customize/telemetry).
3. Also in `config.json`, set the default model to a local model. You can available options [here](/customization/models#openai).
4. Restart VS Code to ensure that the changes to `config.json` or `config.yaml` take effect.
