<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="robot">
  A fully automated workflow that uses Continue CLI with the PostHog MCP to fetch analytics data, analyze user experience issues with AI, and automatically create GitHub
  issues with the GitHub CLI.
</Card>

## What You'll Learn

This cookbook teaches you to:

- Use [PostHog MCP](https://posthog.com/docs/model-context-protocol) to query [analytics](https://posthog.com/docs/web-analytics), [errors](https://posthog.com/docs/error-tracking), and [feature flags](https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags)
- Analyze user behavior patterns with AI
- Automatically create GitHub issues using GitHub CLI

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- GitHub repository where you want to create issues
- [PostHog account](https://posthog.com) with [session recordings enabled](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/installation) and data collecting
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli) with **active credits** (required for API usage)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed (`gh` command)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Continue CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @continuedev/cli
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up Continue CLI Account & API Key">
        1. Visit [Continue Organizations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations)
        2. Sign up or log in to your Continue account
        3. Navigate to your organization settings
        4. Click **"API Keys"** and then **"+ New API Key"** 
        5. Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again!)
        6. Login to the CLI: `cn login`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Required Secrets to Continue CLI">
    Continue CLI will securely store your API keys as secrets that can be referenced in prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Continue CLI handles the complex API interactions - you just need to provide
  the right prompts!
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials

First, you'll need to gather your PostHog and GitHub API credentials and add them as secrets in Continue CLI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="PostHog API Credentials">
    You'll need a **Personal API Key** (not a Project API key) to access session recordings:

    1. Go to [Personal API Keys](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) in PostHog
    2. Click **+ Create a personal API Key**
    3. Name it "Continue CLI Session Analysis"
    4. Select these scopes:
       - `session_recording:read` - **Required** for accessing session data
       - `insight:read`
       - `query:read`
       - `session_recording_playlist:read`
    5. Copy the key immediately (you won't see it again!)
    6. Note your **Project ID** from your PostHog project settings
    7. Note your PostHog host URL (e.g., `https://us.posthog.com` or your custom domain)
    8. You'll also need your POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER value, which is simply `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

      <Info>
  **Continue Secrets**: The `POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER` secret should be stored in
  Continue's secure secrets storage. This keeps your API key safe and the MCP
  automatically connects to your default PostHog project.
</Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Set Up GitHub CLI Authentication">
   GitHub CLI handles authentication automatically - no manual PAT needed:

    1. Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
    2. Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts
    3. Choose authentication method (browser or token)
    4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted (`issues:write` is **required** for creating issues)

  </Tab>
<Tab title= "Configure API Access in Continue CLI">
 
<Tip>
See https://docs.continue.dev/hub/secrets/secret-types#secret-types for adding secrets
</Tip>

You only need to configure the PostHog MCP credential - it automatically handles project selection. To add environment variables to your Continue Hub account:

1.  Go to the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev)
2.  Sign in to your account
3.  Navigate to your user settings
4.  Look for the "Secrets" section
5.  Add your Personal API Key from PostHog (phx_...) as POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER secret with format: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## PostHog GitHub Continuous AI Workflow Options

<Card title="üöÄ Fastest Path to Success" icon="zap">
  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built PostHog GitHub agent that includes
  optimized prompts, rules, and the PostHog MCP for more consistent results.
</Card>

<Info>
  **How PostHog MCP Works**: 
  - Your API key is tied to your PostHog account and
  organization 
  - It automatically uses your default project (no project ID
  needed) 
  - If you have multiple projects, use `mcp__posthog__switch-project` to
  change 
  - The MCP connects via `https://mcp.posthog.com/sse` using your account context.

</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="‚ö° Quick Start (Recommended)">
    **Perfect for:** Immediate results with optimized prompts and built-in debugging

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add the Pre-Built Agent">
        Visit the [PostHog GitHub Continuous AI Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/awesome-models-posthog-gh) on Continue Hub and click **"Install Agent"** or run:
        
        ```bash
        cn --config continuedev/awesome-models-posthog-gh
        ```

        This agent includes:
        - **Optimized prompts** for [PostHog analysis](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/posthog-analysis) and [GitHub issue creation](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/posthog-github-issues)
        - **[Built-in rules](https://hub.continue.dev/bekah-hawrot-weigel/posthog-github-continuous-ai-rules)** for consistent formatting and error handling
        - **[PostHog MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/posthog/posthog-mcp)** for more reliable API interactions
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run the Analysis">
        Navigate to your project directory and run:
        ```bash
        cn "Give me my PostHog Session data and create GitHub issues based on the problems."
        ```

        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Why Use the Agent?** Results are more consistent and debugging is easier thanks to the PostHog MCP integration and pre-tested prompts.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Add PostHog MCP to Continue CLI">
      First, install the [PostHog MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/posthog/posthog-mcp) or run:
      ```bash
      npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://mcp.posthog.com/sse --header Authorization:${{ secrets.continuedev/awesome-models-posthog-gh/posthog/posthog-mcp/POSTHOG_AUTH_HEADER }}
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add PostHog + GitHub Analysis Rules">
    In the Continue Hub, add the [PostHog GitHub Continuous AI Rules](https://hub.continue.dev/bekah-hawrot-weigel/posthog-github-continuous-ai-rules) to your account for better formatting and error handling.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Your Custom Prompts">
      Use this prompt with Continue CLI to analyze PostHog data and create GitHub issues:

      ```bash

       # In cn TUI mode:
      "Create GitHub issues from the PostHog analysis using gh CLI:
      - For each issue, run: gh issue create --title 'üîç UX Issue: [title]' --body '[details]'
      - Add labels: --label 'bug,user-experience,automated'
      - Set priority labels (high/medium/low)
      - Include session data and technical details in the body
      Execute the commands and confirm each issue was created with URL."
      ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Info>

  **Why GitHub CLI over GitHub MCP**: While GitHub MCP is available, it can be
  token-expensive to run. The `gh` CLI is more efficient, requires no API tokens
  (authenticated via `gh auth login`), and provides a cleaner command-line
  experience. GitHub MCP remains an option if you prefer full MCP integration.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Agent Requirements">
    To use the pre-built agent, you need either: 
      - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with
      the models add-on, OR 
      - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Hub secrets
      (same as Step 1 below) The agent will automatically detect and use your
      configuration.

</Accordion>

---

<Warning>
**Repository Labels Required**: Make sure your GitHub repository has these labels:
- `bug`, `enhancement` 
- `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`
- `user-experience`, `automated`

Create missing labels in your repo at: **Settings ‚Üí Labels ‚Üí New label**

</Warning>

<Info>
  **What Continue CLI Does:** - Parses your analysis results automatically -
  Makes authenticated GitHub API calls using your stored token - Creates
  properly formatted issues with appropriate labels - Checks for duplicate
  issues to avoid spam - Provides confirmation with issue URLs
</Info>

## Setting Up Automated GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs your Continue CLI analysis automatically on a schedule.

### Add GitHub Secrets

First, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to **Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add:
   - `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from hub.continue.dev

### Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/posthog-analysis.yml` in your repository:

          # Create the analysis prompt
          I need you to help me analyze PostHog session recordings to identify UX issues. Please:

          1. First, fetch session recordings from PostHog using these details:
             - Use the POSTHOG_API_KEY, POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID, and POSTHOG_HOST from my secrets
             - API endpoint: {POSTHOG_HOST}/api/projects/{POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID}/session_recordings/?limit=20
             - Include Authorization header: 'Bearer {POSTHOG_API_KEY}'

          2. Filter the sessions to find problematic ones with either:
             - console_error_count > 0 (JavaScript errors)
             - recording_duration > 300 (sessions longer than 5 minutes)

          3. Analyze the filtered sessions and create exactly 3 GitHub issues for the most critical UX problems.

          4. Format each issue like this:
          ### 1. **Issue Title Here**
          **Problem**: One sentence describing the user problem
          **Technical Causes**: Brief technical explanation
          **Affected Pages**: List the URLs
          **Recommended Fix**:
          - Specific action item 1
          - Specific action item 2
          **Priority**: **HIGH** or **MEDIUM** or **LOW**
          **Impact**: Quantify the impact (e.g., 'Affects 80% of sessions')

          Please make the API call, analyze the data, and provide the 3 formatted issues. Base all recommendations on actual patterns in the session data.
          EOF

          echo "‚úÖ Analysis completed"


      - name: Create GitHub Issues from Analysis
        run: |
          echo "üìù Creating GitHub issues from analysis..."
          # Create the issue creation prompt
          I have analyzed PostHog session data and identified UX issues. Now I need you to create GitHub issues using the GitHub API.

          For each issue in my analysis:
          1. Parse the issue title, body content, and priority level
          2. Create a GitHub issue via API POST to: https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues
          3. Use these headers:
             - Authorization: token {GITHUB_PAT}
             - Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
             - Content-Type: application/json
          4. Set labels based on priority:
             - HIGH: ["bug", "high-priority", "user-experience", "automated"]
             - MEDIUM: ["enhancement", "medium-priority", "user-experience", "automated"]
             - LOW: ["low-priority", "user-experience", "automated"]
          5. Format the issue title as: "üîç UX Issue: {original title}"

          Please create the GitHub issues and confirm they were successfully created with issue numbers and URLs.

          echo "‚úÖ Issue creation completed"

      - name: Summary
        run: |
          echo "‚úÖ PostHog analysis workflow completed!"
          echo "üêõ Check your repository issues for newly created UX issues"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test the GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Manual Trigger**: Go to **Actions** tab in your repository and manually trigger the workflow
2. **Check Artifacts**: Download the analysis results from the workflow run
3. **Verify Issues**: Check that GitHub issues were created in your repository

<Check>

    **Success Indicators:**
    - PostHog API returns session data (not empty)
    - Continue CLI generates analysis with identified issues
    - GitHub issues are created with proper labels and formatting
    - Workflow completes without errors

</Check>

</Card>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>

    **Protect Your API Keys:**
    - Store all credentials as GitHub Secrets, never in
    code
    - Use Continue CLI's secure secret storage
    - Limit token scopes to minimum required permissions
    - Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
    - Monitor token usage for unusual activity

</Warning>
