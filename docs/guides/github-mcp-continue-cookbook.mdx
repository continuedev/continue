<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="github">
  A GitHub workflow assistant that uses Continue with the GitHub MCP to:
  - List, filter, and summarize open issues
  - Review and summarize recently merged PRs
  - Post comments with AI-generated summaries or checklists
  - Automate routine GitHub maintenance with headless CLI runs
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Continue account with **Hub access**
  - Read: [Understanding Configs — How to get started with Hub configs](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs)
- Node.js 22+ installed locally
- A GitHub account and a repository to work with
- A GitHub token with the appropriate scopes:
  - For read-only: `repo:read`
  - To comment on issues/PRs: `public_repo` for public repos or `repo` for private repos

For all options, first:
<Steps>
<Step title="Install Continue CLI">
  ```bash
  npm i -g @continuedev/cli
  ```
  </Step>

<Step title="Configure GitHub Token">
  Add your `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your [Continue Mission Control agent's environment variables](https://hub.continue.dev/settings).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  To use agents in headless mode, you need a [Continue API key](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys).
  For write actions (e.g., posting comments), your token must include the relevant GitHub scopes.
</Warning>

## GitHub MCP Workflow Options

<Card title="🚀 Fastest Path to Success" icon="rocket">
  Use the GitHub MCP from Continue Mission Control for one-click setup, or add it via CLI.
</Card>

After ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install GitHub MCP via Continue Mission Control">
        Visit the [GitHub Project Manager Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/github-project-manager-agent) on Continue Mission Control and click **Install** to add it to your agent.

        The listing provides a pre-configured MCP block; add your `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Hub.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Launch the Agent">
        From your repo root:
        ```bash
        cn --agent continuedev/github-project-manager-agent
        ```
        Now try: "List my open issues labeled bug and summarize priorities."
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      You can also attach an MCP to a one-off session: `cn --mcp anthropic/github-mcp`.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🛠️ Manual Setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a New Agent on Continue Mission Control">
        Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add GitHub MCP">
        Install from Hub (recommended) or add YAML manually. Minimal YAML example:

        ```yaml title="config.yaml"
        name: My Config
        version: 0.0.1
        schema: v1

        mcpServers:
          - name: GitHub MCP
            command: npx
            args:
              - "-y"
              - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}
            connectionTimeout: 30
        ```

        Notes:
        - The exact `command`/`args` may differ based on the MCP you choose on Hub. Hub templates prefill these for you.
        - Provide `GITHUB_TOKEN` via environment or Hub secrets.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Test the Connection">
        Launch Continue and ask:
        ```
        List the 5 most recently updated open issues in this repository.
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Agent Requirements">
    To use GitHub MCP with Continue CLI, you need either:
      - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR
      - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Mission Control secrets

    The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration along with the GitHub MCP for issue and PR operations.

</Accordion>

## Issue Workflows

Use natural language to explore, triage, and act on open issues. The agent calls GitHub MCP tools under the hood.

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt" --auto` for automation
  
  To run any of the example prompts below in headless mode, use `cn -p "prompt"`
</Info>

### Triage and Summaries

<Card title="Summarize Open Issues" icon="clipboard-list">
  Get a prioritized overview of current open issues.

**Prompt:**
```
List the 20 most recently updated open issues in this repo.
Cluster by label and severity. Summarize top priorities.
```
</Card>

<Card title="Owner/Label Filters" icon="filter">
  Narrow by label or assignee.

**Prompt:**
```
Show open issues labeled bug or security, assigned to @me.
Summarize blockers and suggest next steps.
```
</Card>

### Taking Action

<Card title="Comment on an Issue" icon="comment">

## Automate with GitHub Actions

Run headless commands on a schedule or in PRs to keep teams informed.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: From [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A token with permissions to read issues/PRs and post comments

### Example Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/github-mcp-reports.yml`:

```yaml
name: GitHub MCP Reports

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 13 * * 1"  # Mondays 13:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - name: Install Continue CLI
        run: npm i -g @continuedev/cli

      - name: Weekly Issue Triage Summary
        if: github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
        run: |
          cn --agent continuedev/github-project-manager-agent \
             -p "List open issues updated in the last 14 days. Group by label and priority. Propose top 5 actions and include issue links." \
             --auto > issue_summary.txt

      - name: Post PR Context Comment
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        env:
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
        run: |
          REPORT=$(        cn --agent continuedev/github-project-manager-agent \
            -p "Summarize the context for PR #${PR_NUMBER}: related open issues, risk areas, and test suggestions. Keep under 200 words." \
            --auto)
          gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} --body "$REPORT"
```

<Info>
  Use `continuedev/github-project-manager-agent` consistently throughout your automation as the recommended agent configuration.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing or invalid token:** Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set and has the required scopes. Try a minimal test: “List 3 open issues in this repo”.
- **Permissions errors on comment:** Your token must include `public_repo` (public) or `repo` (private) to write comments.
- **Rate limiting:** Reduce frequency or filter queries; consider using a PAT distinct from the default Actions token when running in CI.
- **MCP connection timeout:** If using custom YAML, increase `connectionTimeout` or verify the `command`/`args` from Mission Control listing.
