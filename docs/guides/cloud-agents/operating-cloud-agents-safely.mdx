<Card title="The Goal">

Cloud agents should reduce risk and interruptions not introduce new ones. This guide covers practical guardrails that make cloud agents safe for real teams.
</Card>

## The Safety Baseline for Cloud Agents

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Ownership">
    Every workflow has a named owner and an escalation path.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reviewability">
    Outputs are diffable, explainable, and revertible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bounded Scope">
    One repo → 
    one workflow → 
    one trigger. 
    *Expand only after success.*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## A Safe Adoption Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Manual">
    Run as a one-off task. Validate cloud agent outputs and define acceptance criteria.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move to Assisted">
    Allow automated triggering, but keep human approval before merge/action.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automate Selectively">
    Only automate workflows with predictable blast radius, clear rollback, and stable output quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning title="The most common failure">
Cloud agents don’t fail because they’re autonomous.  
They fail because teams automate before they’ve defined review criteria and ownership.
</Warning>

## 1) Ownership Comes First

Before you automate anything, make these true:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Name an Owner">
    One person is responsible for:  
    - reviewing outcomes  
    - tuning prompts/rules  
    - responding to failures  
  </Card>

  <Card title="Define Escalation">
    Decide what happens when:  
    - the cloud agent can’t complete work  
    - output confidence is low  
    - a run fails repeatedly  
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What good ownership looks like">
    - The workflow has a dedicated Slack channel or notification route  
    - There is a “stop the line” decision owner  
    - Ownership does not rotate implicitly (it’s explicit)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Red flags">
    - “Whoever sees it first” is the owner  
    - Alerts route to a general channel with no responder  
    - No one feels safe turning it off
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2) Constrain Blast Radius

The fastest path to trust is a smaller blast radius.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Start with One Repo">
    Pick a low-risk repo or a single service to prove value.
  </Card>

  <Card title="One Class of Issues">
    Narrow the scope: one recurring error type, one vuln class, one cleanup task.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cap Output Size">
    Set expectations like “no more than N files” or “single dependency PRs.”
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="info" title="A good first constraint">
Prefer PRs and reports over direct writes or production actions.
</Callout>

## 3) Review Is the Safety Rail

Treat every cloud agent run like you’d treat a teammate’s PR.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Review checklist">
    Use a lightweight checklist:

    - [ ] Does the change match the prompt intent?
    - [ ] Is the blast radius clear?
    - [ ] Are tests updated or unaffected?
    - [ ] Are failure cases acceptable?
    - [ ] Is rollback straightforward?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What “reviewable” means">
    Reviewable outputs are:

    - **Diffable** (PRs, patches, file changes)
    - **Explainable** (short rationale, linked inputs)
    - **Revertible** (easy rollback path)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="When to block merge">
    Block merge when:

    - scope is unexpectedly broad
    - behavior changes are unclear
    - it introduces new dependencies without justification
    - it “fixes” by deleting or disabling core functionality
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4) Permissions: Least Privilege by Default

Give agents the smallest set of permissions required for the job.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission guidelines">
    - Prefer **read-only** until the workflow proves reliable  
    - Prefer **PR creation** over direct push  
    - Scope external tools (Sentry/Snyk/etc.) to the minimum endpoints  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Practical permission levels">
    - Level 1: Read repo + create report  
    - Level 2: Create PRs (drafts first)  
    - Level 3: Update PRs based on review comments  
    - Level 4: Automate merges only for narrow, proven workflows  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid early">
Do not start with permissions that allow silent writes to main or production mutations.
</Callout>

## 5) Observability & Auditability

If you can’t answer these questions, you don’t have a safe system yet:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Run provenance">
    - What ran?  
    - Why did it run?  
    - What inputs did it use?
  </Card>

  <Card title="Outcome tracking">
    - What did it change?  
    - Who reviewed/approved it?  
    - Did it succeed or require intervention?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="info" title="Why this matters">
Auditability turns “AI did something” into “we can explain what happened.”
That’s the difference between experimentation and production.
</Callout>

## 6) Failure Handling & Safe Defaults

Set defaults that fail safely.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recommended default behaviors">
    - **Fail closed** (no silent actions)  
    - If uncertain, produce a **report** instead of a change  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Common failure modes">
    - External tool API is unavailable  
    - Repo state changed mid-run  
    - Cloud agent proposes a fix that doesn’t pass CI  
    - Output becomes noisy (too many PRs/reports)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recovery playbook">
    - Pause the workflow  
    - Reduce scope / increase constraints  
    - Move back a governance level (Automated → Assisted → Manual)  
    - Update acceptance criteria and rerun
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pre-Flight Checklist

<Card icon="cloud-check" title="Ready to run safely?">
- [ ] Workflow owner is named  
- [ ] Trigger is defined and bounded  
- [ ] Outputs are reviewable (PR/report)  
- [ ] Permissions follow least-privilege  
- [ ] Blast radius is constrained  
- [ ] Failure handling is defined  
- [ ] There is a way to pause/disable quickly  
</Card>
