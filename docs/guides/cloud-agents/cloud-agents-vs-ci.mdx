<Card title="Why Cloud Agents vs CI/CD?">
Many teams see cloud agents and think: “Isn’t this just CI?” Sometimes the answer is yes and that’s good. CI is excellent. This guide explains the boundary so you choose the right tool.

## What CI/CD Is Great At

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CI/CD Excels When">
    - **Deterministic** — the same inputs produce the same results  
    - **Repeatable** — runs consistently on every commit  
    - **Policy-enforced** — clear pass/fail rules  
    - **Strongly testable** — success can be verified automatically  
  </Card>

  <Card title="Common CI/CD Tasks">
    - Run tests  
    - Build artifacts  
    - Enforce lint rules  
    - Run static analysis  
    - Execute fixed scripts  
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Where CI/CD Breaks Down

CI/CD is weaker when the work requires:
- interpretation of changing signals
- multi-system context (errors + analytics + issues)
- generating patches with reasoning
- summarizing incidents across tools
- deciding next steps based on incomplete information


## What Cloud Agents Add

Cloud agents are useful when the job is:
- triage + propose
- interpret + summarize
- patch + open a PR
- coordinate across systems

<Info>
CI is the best executor of deterministic checks. Cloud agents are best at interpreting signals and producing reviewable outcomes.

## Practical Pairings for CI + Cloud Agents

### Pattern 1: CI detects, Agent responds
- CI detects failure or policy issue
- Cloud agent proposes fix and opens PR
- Human reviews

### Pattern 2: Agent prepares, CI verifies
- Cloud agent proposes changes
- CI runs tests and checks
- PR is only mergeable if CI passes

### Pattern 3: Agent maintains, CI enforces
- Agent keeps dependencies tidy weekly
- CI ensures nothing breaks on merge


## A Simple Decision Table

| If your work is... | Prefer... |
|---|---|
| deterministic & testable | CI/CD |
| interpretive & contextual | Cloud agent |
| needs a patch proposal | Cloud agent + CI validation |
| needs strict policy enforcement | CI/CD |
