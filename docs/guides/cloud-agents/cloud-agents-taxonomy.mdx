## Why This Taxonomy Exists

“Cloud agents” is a term that gets used to describe everything from cron jobs to IDE copilots.

That ambiguity causes teams to:
- choose the wrong abstraction
- automate too early
- or avoid cloud agents entirely because they feel risky

This guide exists to do one thing clearly:

> **Define what cloud agents actually are, how they differ from other agents, and when they make sense for real software teams.**

No hype. No product tour. Just a clean mental model you can reuse.

## A Clear Definition

<Callout type="info" title="Definition">
A **cloud agent** is an AI-driven process that runs on remote infrastructure and is triggered by tasks, schedules, or external events across a team’s engineering systems.  
</Callout>

Key characteristics:
- runs outside a developer’s local environment
- operates on shared team context (repos, alerts, analytics, infra)
- produces reviewable outcomes (PRs, reports, actions)
- can run asynchronously and repeatedly

Cloud agents are not about writing code faster.  
They exist to **own work that keeps coming back**.

## What Cloud Agents Are Not

Cloud agents are often confused with other tools.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Not IDE Agents">
    IDE agents focus on individual productivity and local context.  
    Cloud agents operate on shared systems and team-owned work.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Not Cron Jobs">
    Cron jobs execute fixed scripts.  
    Cloud agents reason, adapt, and act based on changing inputs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Not One-Off Scripts">
    Scripts solve a moment.  
    Cloud agents manage recurring classes of work.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Not Magic Automation">
    Cloud agents still require review, ownership, and guardrails.
  </Card>

## The Two Axes That Matter

Cloud agents are best understood along **two dimensions**:
1. **What triggers them**
2. **How they’re governed**

Everything else is implementation detail.

---

## Axis 1: Trigger Type

### 1. One-Off Cloud Agents  
**Manually triggered**

<Card>
Used when a human explicitly dispatches work to an agent.
</Card>

**Examples**
- Analyze the top recurring Sentry errors
- Audit a repo for security issues
- Summarize system behavior

**Best for**
- unknown scope
- exploratory work
- building confidence before automation

---

### 2. Scheduled Cloud Agents  
**Time-based triggers**

<Card>
Run on a fixed cadence (daily, weekly, hourly).
</Card>

**Examples**
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Nightly analytics summaries
- Regular dependency updates

**Best for**
- predictable recurring work
- backlog prevention
- drift detection

---

### 3. Event-Driven Cloud Agents  
**Signal-based triggers**

<Card>
React to real-time events from external systems.
</Card>

**Examples**
- New high-severity alert
- Failed deployment
- Critical security finding

**Best for**
- operational workflows
- incident response
- time-sensitive fixes

---

## Axis 2: Governance Level

This is where most teams get into trouble.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Human decides when the agent runs  
    Human reviews everything  

    Safest starting point.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Assisted">
    Agent runs automatically  
    Human approves outcomes  

    Where most teams should live first.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automated">
    Agent runs unattended  
    Outcomes merge or act directly  

    Earned over time — not assumed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
Cloud agents don’t fail because they’re autonomous.  
They fail because teams skip the control phase.
</Callout>

## Cloud Agents vs Local / IDE Agents

| Local / IDE Agents | Cloud Agents |
|------------------|-------------|
| Individual context | Team context |
| Short-lived | Long-running |
| Developer-initiated | System-initiated |
| Productivity focus | Reliability & ownership focus |

Both are useful.  
They solve **different problems**.

---

## Why Cloud Agents Exist at All

Most engineering pain is not complexity.

It’s **recurrence**.

- alerts repeat
- security issues resurface
- operational work interrupts feature work

Cloud agents exist to:
- notice repetition
- respond consistently
- reduce future interruptions

The goal is not more automation.  
The goal is **less work over time**.

---

## When Cloud Agents Make Sense

Use cloud agents when:
- the same class of issue keeps returning
- the cost is in handling, not solving
- work spans multiple systems
- review and traceability matter

Avoid them when:
- the problem is novel
- ownership is unclear
- blast radius isn’t understood yet

---

## The Architectural Reality

As teams adopt cloud agents, they discover a final truth:

> **Agents alone don’t scale.  
Control and visibility do.**

Production cloud agents eventually require:
- a shared place to review runs
- a record of decisions
- adjustable prompts and rules
- gradual automation

Without this, cloud agents become brittle fast.

## One Sentence to Remember

<Callout type="success">
Cloud agents are how teams take ownership of work that happens after code ships.
