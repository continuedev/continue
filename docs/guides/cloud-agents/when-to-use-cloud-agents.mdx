## Start Here

This guide helps you decide whether **cloud agents** are the right abstraction for your problem.

If you want the canonical definition and taxonomy first, read:

  Definitions, trigger types, and governance levels.
</Card>

## When Cloud Agents Make Sense
<Tip>
Use cloud agents when the work is **recurring**, spans **multiple systems**, and needs **team-owned outcomes**.
</Tip>

Use cloud agents when:

- The same class of issue returns weekly (or daily)
- The work is mostly *handling* (triage, patching, cleanup), not discovery
- Inputs come from tools like GitHub, error monitoring, security scanners, analytics
- You need a reviewable outcome (PR, report, ticket update)
- You want to reduce interruptions, not just respond faster

    - dependency hygiene  
    - analytics-driven fixes

## When Cloud Agents Are a Bad Idea

Avoid cloud agents when:

- The problem is novel and poorly understood
- The blast radius is unclear
- Ownership is ambiguous (“someone should handle this”)
- You can’t define review criteria
- The work is better solved by eliminating the root cause directly

<Warning>
Cloud agents amplify whatever system you already have.  
If ownership is unclear, automation will make it worse.
</Warning>


## Cloud Agents vs Alternatives

### Cloud Agents vs Scripts
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose scripts when..." icon="terminal">
    - the logic is deterministic  
    - inputs are stable  
    - you don’t need reasoning  
    - you want maximum predictability  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose cloud agents when..." icon="cloud">
    - inputs change and need interpretation  
    - work spans tools and context  
    - you need a human-reviewable outcome  
    - you want to reduce recurring toil  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Cloud Agents vs CI Jobs
CI jobs are excellent at:
- running tests and builds deterministically
- enforcing policy checks
- executing repeatable scripts

Cloud agents are better for:
- interpreting signals and context
- producing patches or summaries
- coordinating actions across systems

</Card>

### Cloud Agents vs Local / IDE Agents
Local agents are best for:
- fast iteration
- individual workflows
- exploratory work

Cloud agents are best for:
- shared team context
- reliability-oriented work
- recurring tasks and triggers

## The Decision Checklist

Use cloud agents if you can say “yes” to most of these:

- [ ] We’ve seen this problem at least twice  
- [ ] Inputs come from shared systems (alerts, issues, analytics)  
- [ ] We can define what “good output” looks like  
- [ ] A PR/report is an acceptable artifact  
- [ ] Someone owns reviewing the result  
- [ ] We can start in a manual or assisted mode  

<Info>
If you’re unsure, start with a one-off [task](../../mission-control/tasks) and treat it like an experiment.
