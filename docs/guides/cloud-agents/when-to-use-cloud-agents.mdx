## When Cloud Agents Make Sense
This guide helps you decide whether **cloud agents** are the right abstraction for your problem.

<Tip>
Use cloud agents when the work is **recurring**, spans **multiple systems**, and needs **team-owned outcomes**. If you want the canonical definition and taxonomy first, read: [Cloud Agents Taxonomy](/guides/cloud-agents/cloud-agents-taxonomy).
</Tip>

Use cloud agents when:

- The same class of issue returns weekly (or daily)
- The work is mostly handling (triage, patching, cleanup), not discovery
- Inputs come from tools like GitHub, error monitoring, security scanners, analytics
- You need a reviewable outcome (PR, report, ticket update)
- You want to reduce interruptions, not just respond faster

## When Cloud Agents Are a Bad Idea

Avoid cloud agents when:

- The problem is novel and poorly understood
- The blast radius is unclear
- Ownership is ambiguous (“someone should handle this”)
- You can’t define review criteria
- The work is better solved by eliminating the root cause directly

<Warning>
Cloud agents amplify whatever system you already have. If ownership is unclear, automation will make it worse.
</Warning>


## Cloud Agents vs Alternatives

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Scripts / CI Jobs | Local Agents (TUI) | Cloud Agents (Headless) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Deterministic (If/Then) | AI / Probabilistic | AI / Probabilistic |
| **Context** | Inputs only | Full Repo + User Chat | Repo + Integrations (Snyk/GitHub/etc.) |
| **Interaction** | None (Logs only) | Interactive (Conversations) | Autonomous (Fire & Forget)  |
| **Tool Access** | Unlimited | All (Ask permission supported)  | Safe (No "Ask" tools)  |
| **Best For** | Testing, Building, Linting | Debugging, Refactoring, Exploration | Triage, Remediation, Reporting |

## The Decision Checklist

Use cloud agents if you can say “yes” to most of these:

- [ ] We’ve seen this problem at least twice  
- [ ] Inputs come from shared systems (alerts, issues, analytics)  
- [ ] We can define what “good output” looks like  
- [ ] A PR/report is an acceptable artifact  
- [ ] Someone owns reviewing the result  
- [ ] We can start in a manual or assisted mode  

<Info>
If you’re unsure, start with a one-off [task](../../mission-control/tasks) and treat it like an experiment.
