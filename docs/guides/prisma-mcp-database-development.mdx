## Step 2: Design Your Database Schema with AI

Use Continue CLI to design your database schema through natural language prompts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="E-commerce Schema">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Design a complete e-commerce database schema with:

    Tables:
    - Users (authentication, profiles, addresses)
    - Products (variants, inventory, categories)
    - Orders (line items, status tracking, shipping)
    - Reviews (ratings, comments, helpful votes)
    - Carts (temporary shopping carts)

    Requirements:
    - Use UUIDs for all IDs
    - Add proper relationships (foreign keys)
    - Include created_at and updated_at timestamps
    - Add soft deletes for users and products
    - Create indexes for:
      * Product searches (name, category)
      * Order lookups (user_id, status, created_at)
      * Review queries (product_id, user_id)

    Generate the Prisma schema and initial migration.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SaaS Application Schema">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Design a SaaS multi-tenant database schema with:

    Tables:
    - Organizations (tenants)
    - Users (with organization membership)
    - Projects (belonging to organizations)
    - Tasks (belonging to projects)
    - Comments (on tasks)
    - Subscriptions (billing info)

    Requirements:
    - Ensure data isolation between organizations
    - Add role-based access control (admin, member, viewer)
    - Track who created and updated records
    - Add indexes for tenant-scoped queries
    - Include audit logging fields

    Generate a Prisma schema that enforces multi-tenancy.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Blog Platform Schema">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Design a blog platform database with:

    Tables:
    - Users (authors and readers)
    - Posts (with drafts and published states)
    - Comments (nested/threaded)

    - Categories (hierarchical)
    - Likes (on posts and comments)

    Features:
    - SEO-friendly slugs for posts
    - View count tracking
    - Featured/pinned posts
    - Comment moderation status

    Include proper indexes for:
    - Post listing by date, popularity, category
    - Tag-based searches
    - User activity tracking
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Prisma Remote MCP Capabilities for Schema Design**:
  - Validates schema syntax automatically
  - Suggests optimal data types and relationships
  - Recommends indexes based on query patterns
  - Warns about potential performance issues
  - Leverages Prisma's hosted AI models for enhanced schema recommendations
</Info>

## Step 3: Generate and Apply Migrations

Create database migrations from your schema design and apply them safely.

**Example: Complete Migration Workflow**

```
I've designed my Prisma schema. Now I need to:

1. Check the current migration status
2. Create a new migration named "initial_schema"
3. Review the generated SQL before applying
4. Apply the migration to the database
5. Verify all tables were created correctly

For the migration:
- Include all schema changes
- Add helpful comments in the SQL
- Show me the migration file contents
- Confirm the migration was applied successfully

Database: PostgreSQL
Environment: Development
```

**Expected Output:**
The AI will:
- Run `prisma migrate status` to check current state
- Generate migration with `prisma migrate dev --name initial_schema`
- Show you the SQL file contents for review
- Apply the migration automatically
- Verify tables exist using database inspection

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Always review AI-generated migrations before applying to production. Test in development first!
</Tip>

## Step 4: Seed Your Database with Realistic Data

Generate realistic seed data for development and testing.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="E-commerce Seed Data">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Create a comprehensive seed script for my e-commerce database:

    Generate:
    - 50 users with realistic names and emails
    - 200 products across 10 categories
      * Include product variants (size, color)
      * Set realistic prices and inventory
    - 100 orders with random items
      * Various order statuses (pending, shipped, delivered)
      * Created at different dates over the past 6 months
    - 300 product reviews
      * Ratings from 1-5 stars
      * Realistic review text
      * Mix of helpful/not helpful votes

    Requirements:
    - Use realistic fake data (not just "User 1", "Product 1")
    - Maintain referential integrity
    - Distribute data realistically (more delivered than pending orders)
    - Add some edge cases (cancelled orders, out-of-stock items)

    Create the seed.ts file and show me how to run it.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SaaS Seed Data">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    Create seed data for my SaaS application:

    Organizations:
    - 10 organizations (different sizes: small, medium, enterprise)
    - Each with appropriate subscription tier

    Users:
    - 50 total users distributed across organizations
    - Mix of roles (admin, member, viewer)
    - Realistic activity patterns

    Projects and Tasks:
    - 30 projects across all organizations
    - 200 tasks with various statuses
    - Assign tasks to users in the same organization
    - Add comments from team members

    Demonstrate multi-tenancy by ensuring data isolation.
    Create the seed script with TypeScript.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Prisma Seed Best Practices**:
  - Use `faker` or similar libraries for realistic data
  - Run seeds in transactions for consistency
  - Make seeds idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
  - Include edge cases and test scenarios
</Info>

## Step 5: Launch Prisma Studio for Visual Management

Use Prisma Studio to visually explore and manage your database.

**Prompt:**
```
Launch Prisma Studio so I can visually inspect my database tables and data
```

The AI will:
- Run `prisma studio` command
- Open Studio in your browser (usually http://localhost:5555)
- Show you how to navigate the interface

<Tip>
  **Prisma Studio Features**:
  - Browse all tables and relationships
  - Edit records directly
  - Filter and search data
  - View relationship connections visually
</Tip>

## Step 6: Automate Database Health Checks

Set up automated database monitoring with Continue CLI and GitHub Actions:

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'prisma/**'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'prisma/**'
  schedule:
    # Run daily at 3 AM UTC
    - cron: "0 3 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers

jobs:
  check-database-health:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install
          npm install -g @continuedev/cli
          echo "✅ Dependencies installed"

      - name: Setup Database
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
        run: |
          npx prisma migrate deploy
          echo "✅ Migrations applied"

      - name: Analyze Database Schema
        env:
          CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Analyzing database health..."

          cn -p "Using Prisma MCP, perform a comprehensive database health check:

                 1. Migration Status:
                    - Check if all migrations are applied
                    - Identify pending migrations
                    - Detect migration conflicts

                 2. Schema Analysis:
                    - Verify all foreign key relationships are valid
                    - Check for missing indexes on foreign keys
                    - Identify tables without primary keys
                    - Find unused indexes (if possible)

                 3. Data Integrity:
                    - Check for orphaned records (broken foreign keys)
                    - Verify required fields don't have nulls
                    - Identify duplicate records in unique columns

                 4. Performance Review:
                    - Suggest missing indexes based on schema
                    - Identify large tables that might need partitioning
                    - Check for inefficient data types

                 5. Best Practices:
                    - Verify created_at/updated_at timestamps exist
                    - Check for soft delete implementations
                    - Ensure proper enum usage

                 Generate a detailed health report with:
                 - Critical issues that need immediate attention
                 - Warnings for potential problems
                 - Optimization suggestions
                 - SQL scripts to fix identified issues

                 If critical issues are found, fail the workflow."

      - name: Save Health Report
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "## 📊 Database Health Report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "Generated at $(date)" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "Check the 'Analyze Database Schema' step for the full report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

      - name: Upload Health Report
        if: always()

  - Use read replicas for analytics queries
  - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
  - Regularly rotate database passwords
  - Use least-privilege database users for applications
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Prisma Remote MCP Connection Issues

If you encounter issues with Prisma Remote MCP:

1. Verify your `PRISMA_AUTH_TOKEN` is correctly set in [Continue Hub Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)
2. Check that the secret key is exactly: `prisma/prisma-remote-mcp/PRISMA_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Ensure you have network connectivity to `https://mcp.prisma.io`
4. Verify your Prisma account has access to the database at [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io)
5. Check your DATABASE_URL is correctly set in `.env` (for local Prisma CLI operations)

### Common Migration Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|:------|:---------|
| Migration conflicts | Reset development database with `prisma migrate reset` |
| Schema drift detected | Run `prisma migrate dev` to sync schema with database |
| Connection refused | Verify DATABASE_URL and database is running |
| Permission denied | Check database user has CREATE/ALTER privileges |

### AI Safety Guardrails

When Prisma Remote MCP detects destructive operations (like `migrate reset`):

1. You'll see a confirmation prompt
2. Review what will be deleted
3. Type "yes" to confirm or "no" to cancel
4. The AI will wait for your response before proceeding

<Info>
  This safety feature prevents accidental data loss when AI agents run database commands. The Prisma Remote MCP enforces these guardrails on the server side for enhanced security.
