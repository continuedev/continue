<Card title="What You'll Build" icon="book-open-cover">
  Master using the Continue Docs MCP to contribute documentation, create cookbooks, and maintain consistency across Continue's docs - all through natural language prompts.
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Continue account with **Hub access**
- Read: [Contributing to Continue Documentation](/CONTRIBUTING) for setup instructions
- Forked the [continuedev/continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) repository

  This cookbook assumes you've read the setup in the [CONTRIBUTING guide](/CONTRIBUTING). If you haven't, start there first.
</Warning>

## Continue Docs MCP Setup

<Card title="Fastest Path to Success" icon="rocket">
  Use the pre-built [Docs Assistant - Mintlify agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/docs-mintlify) that includes the Continue Docs MCP and is ready to use immediately.
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    # From your Continue docs directory
    cn --config continuedev/docs-mintlify
    ```

    This agent includes:
    - **Continue Docs MCP** for searching Continue documentation
    - **Mintlify formatting rules** for proper component usage
    - **Documentation-focused prompts** for common tasks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🛠️ Custom Agent">
    If you want to customize, create your own agent and add:
    1. [Continue Docs MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/continue-docs-mcp)
    2. [Mintlify Technical Writing Rule](https://hub.continue.dev/mintlify/technical-writing-rule)

## What is the Continue Docs MCP?

<Card title="Continue Docs MCP" icon="circle-info">
  A Model Context Protocol server built with [Mintlify's MCP generation](https://www.mintlify.com/blog/generate-mcp-servers-for-your-docs) that enables semantic search across Continue documentation. [Learn more →](/reference/continue-mcp)
</Card>

The MCP helps you:
- **Find examples** from existing documentation
- **Maintain consistency** with established patterns
- **Source accurate information** about Continue features
- **Write better documentation** faster

## Documentation Workflows with Prompts

### 🆕 Creating a New Cookbook

Cookbooks show how to use Continue CLI with specific tools or services. Here's how to create one using the Continue Docs MCP:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Existing Cookbooks">
    ```bash
    cn --config continuedev/docs-mintlify
    ```

    **Prompt:**
    ```
    "Show me the structure of existing MCP cookbooks in the Continue docs.
    I want to create a cookbook for GitHub MCP."
    ```

    The agent will find examples like the dlt, Snyk, and Sanity cookbooks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Source Official Documentation">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    "Using the Continue Docs MCP, find information about how GitHub MCP works.
    Then search the web for the official GitHub MCP documentation and combine
    both sources to create a cookbook following the same structure as the
    dlt cookbook."
    ```

    The agent will:
    - Search Continue docs for MCP patterns
    - Fetch GitHub MCP official documentation
    - Combine both sources
    - Generate a cookbook with consistent formatting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to Navigation">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    "Add my new github-mcp-continue-cookbook.mdx to the docs.json navigation
    under the Cookbooks section."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and Iterate">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # Visit http://localhost:3000
    ```

    **Refine with prompts:**
    ```
    "Add more examples to the troubleshooting section"
    "Include a CI/CD workflow example using GitHub Actions"
    "Add authentication setup using environment variables"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Pro Tip:** The agent uses the Continue Docs MCP to maintain consistency with existing cookbooks automatically.
</Info>

  <Step title="Make Targeted Updates">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    "Update the MCP tools documentation at docs/customization/mcp-tools.mdx
    to include information about the new Slack MCP server. Use the Continue
    Docs MCP to find examples of how other MCP servers are documented, then
    add a similar section for Slack."
    ```

## Real-World Cookbook Examples

### Example 1: PostgreSQL MCP Cookbook

**Prompt:**
```
"Create a cookbook for using Continue with PostgreSQL MCP. Follow the same
structure as the dlt cookbook, but customize it for database operations.

Include these sections:
1. Quick start with pre-built agent
2. Manual setup with MCP configuration
3. Common database tasks (schema exploration, query writing, migrations)
4. Troubleshooting database connection issues

Use the Continue Docs MCP to find MCP configuration patterns and search the
web for PostgreSQL MCP documentation."
```

### Example 2: Sentry Error Tracking Cookbook

**Prompt:**
```
"Create a cookbook showing how to use Continue to analyze Sentry errors.

The cookbook should demonstrate:
1. Setting up Sentry MCP integration
2. Querying recent errors
3. Analyzing error patterns with AI
4. Generating fixes for common errors
5. CI/CD integration for automated error analysis

Research the Snyk cookbook structure since it's also about error detection,
and adapt it for Sentry."
```

### Example 3: OpenAPI Documentation Cookbook

**Prompt:**
```
"I want to create a cookbook for using Continue to work with OpenAPI specs.

Show how to:
1. Load OpenAPI specs into Continue's context
2. Generate API client code from specs
3. Create tests based on API endpoints
4. Update documentation when APIs change

Use the Continue Docs MCP to find how context providers work, then combine
that with OpenAPI MCP information."
```

          # Create detailed diff
          git diff origin/${{ github.base_ref }}..HEAD > changes.diff

          # Use Continue agent to check if docs need updates
          PROMPT="Review these code changes and determine if documentation updates are needed.

          Changed files: $(cat changed_files.txt | tr '\n' ' ')

          Consider:

          - Breaking changes
          - New configuration options
          - Modified CLI commands
          - New MCP integrations

          If docs updates are needed, specify which files in docs/ should be updated.
          If no updates needed, respond with 'NO_DOCS_NEEDED'.
          Be specific and concise."

          cn --config continuedev/docs-mintlify -p "$PROMPT" --auto > analysis.md || {
