title: "Using Plan Mode with Continue"
description: "Plan Mode gives you a safe, read-only environment to explore your codebase, map out solutions, and collaborate with AI before making any changes. Think of it as your sandbox for understanding and strategy."
---

Plan Mode prevents unintentional file modifications, letting you think through solutions and build confidence before committing to action. The core principle is understand before you change, giving you a research-first approach that prevents costly mistakes and creates better architectural decisions.

## Best Practices

### For Faster Planning

1. **Scope your requests**: `Focus analysis on the user authentication module only, ignore the admin features`
2. **Use targeted context**: `Analyze @Files and its direct imports for security issues`

### For Higher Quality Plans

1. **Provide business context**: `This feature needs to handle Black Friday traffic (10x normal load). Plan accordingly.`
2. **Share technical constraints**: `We're on AWS with strict security requirements. Plan a file upload system that meets SOC2 compliance.`
3. **Ask for risk analysis**: `What could go wrong with this database migration? Plan rollback procedures.`
4. **Request multiple perspectives**: `Show me 3 different approaches to implementing caching in this API, with pros and cons for each.`

## How to Enable Plan Mode

You can switch to `Plan` in the mode selector below the chat input box.

## Context Integration in Plan Mode

Context is the foundation of effective planning. Without proper context, AI models fall back on generic patterns, leading to plans that don't fit your specific system. Continue's [context system](/features/chat/context-selection) transforms broad suggestions into actionable strategies:

| Context Type         | Usage                                                  | Best For                      |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Highlighted Code** | `cmd/ctrl + L` (VS Code) or `cmd/ctrl + J` (JetBrains) | Component-specific analysis   |
| **Active File**      | `opt/alt + enter` when sending request                 | Current file context          |
| **@Files**           | `@Files package.json tsconfig.json`                    | Specific file analysis        |
| **@Folder**          | `@Folder src/auth`                                     | Directory-wide planning       |
| **@Codebase**        | `@Codebase`                                            | Comprehensive system analysis |
| **@Docs**            | `@Docs React Router`                                   | Standards-compliant planning  |
| **@Terminal**        | `@Terminal`                                            | Debugging with output         |
| **@Git Diff**        | `@Git Diff`                                            | Change impact analysis        |

## From Plan to Execution

### When to Transition to Agent Mode

Move to Agent Mode when you have:

✅ **Clear understanding** of the current system  
✅ **Detailed implementation plan** with specific steps  
✅ **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies  
✅ **Team approval** (if required)  
✅ **Success criteria** defined

### Key Takeaways

The three-mode system—Chat for learning, Plan for strategy, and Agent for execution—provides a complete development workflow that scales from simple bug fixes to complex system architecture.

**Remember:**

- Choose the right mode for each task
- Leverage context providers (@Codebase, @Files, @Docs, etc.) for better planning
- Start broad, then focus your planning sessions for better results
- Transition to Agent mode with clear execution steps

The best code is planned code.
