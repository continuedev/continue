## dlt MCP Workflow Options

<Card title="🚀 Fastest Path to Success" icon="zap">
  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent) that includes
      the dlt MCP and optimized data pipeline workflows for more consistent results. You can [remix this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to customize it for your specific needs.
</Card>


After ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Load the Pre-Built Agent">
        Navigate to your pipeline project directory and run:
        ```bash
        cn --agent continuedev/dlt-agent
        ```

        This agent includes:
        - **dlt MCP** pre-configured and ready to use
        - **Pipeline-focused rules** for data engineering best practices
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Your First Pipeline Inspection">
        Start with a comprehensive pipeline check:
        ```bash
        # TUI mode
        Inspect the execution of my dlt pipeline and summarize the load info, including timing and file sizes.
        ```

        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Why Use the Agent?** The pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent) provides consistent pipeline development workflows and handles MCP configuration automatically, making it easier to get started with AI-powered data engineering. You can [remix and customize this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) later to fit your team's specific workflow.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🛠️ Manual Setup">
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent via the Continue Mission Control">
    Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
    </Step>

  <Step title="Connect dlt MCP via Continue Mission Control">
    Visit the [dlt MCP on Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp) and click **Install** to add it to the agent you created in the step above.

    This will add dlt MCP to your agent's available tools. The Mission Control listing automatically configures the MCP command.

    <Tip>
      **Alternative installation methods:**
      1. **Quick CLI install**: `cn --mcp dlthub/dlt-mcp`
      2. **Manual configuration**: Add the MCP to your `~/.continue/config.json` under the `mcpServers` section

      Once installed, dlt MCP tools become available to your Continue agent for all prompts.
    </Tip>

    <Info>
      The MCP will work with your existing dlt pipelines in your current directory.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your First Pipeline Inspection">
    Start with a comprehensive pipeline check:
    ```bash
    # TUI mode
    cn

## dlt MCP vs dlt+ MCP

<Card title="Understanding the Difference" icon="info-circle">
  **dlt MCP** is focused on local pipeline development and inspection. It provides tools to:
  - Inspect pipeline execution and load information
  - Retrieve schema metadata from your local pipelines
  - Query dataset records from destination databases
  - Analyze load errors, timings, and file sizes

  **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** extends these capabilities with cloud-based features for production deployments:
  - Connect to dlt+ Projects and manage deployments
  - Monitor pipeline runs across multiple environments
  - Access centralized logging and observability
  - Collaborate with team members on pipeline development

  For local development and getting started, **[dlt MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp)** is the right choice. Consider **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** when you need production deployment features and team collaboration.
</Card>

## Pipeline Development Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to develop and debug your dlt pipelines. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate dlt MCP tools.

<Info>
You can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt"` for headless commands

  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running pipeline operations that might make
  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode
  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This
  shows you what the agent will do without executing it.
  
  To run any of the example prompts below in headless mode, use `cn -p "prompt"`
</Info>

<Info>

  **About the --auto flag**: The `--auto` flag enables tools to run continuously without manual confirmation. This is essential for headless mode where the agent needs to execute multiple tools automatically to complete tasks like pipeline inspection, schema retrieval, and error analysis.

</Info>

## Continuous Data Pipelines with GitHub Actions

  This example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where data pipeline validation runs automatically in your CI/CD pipeline in headless mode using the [dlt Assistant agent](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-assistant). Consider [remixing this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to add your organization's specific validation rules.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)
- Any required database credentials for your destination

<Info>
      The workflow uses the pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent) with `--agent continuedev/dlt-agent`. This agent comes pre-configured with the dlt MCP and optimized rules for pipeline operations. You can [remix this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to customize the validation rules and prompts for your specific pipeline requirements.
</Info>

### Create Workflow File

This workflow automatically validates your dlt data pipelines on pull requests using the Continue CLI in [headless mode](/cli/overview#headless-mode%3A-production-automation). It inspects pipeline schemas, checks for errors, and posts a summary report as a PR comment. The workflow can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

Create `.github/workflows/dlt-pipeline-validation.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Data Pipeline Validation with dlt MCP

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}

                 - Performance metrics (timing, file sizes)
                 - Recommended improvements" \
             --auto)

          gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "$REPORT"
```

<Info>
  The dlt MCP works with your local pipeline state. Make sure your CI environment
  has access to the necessary pipeline configuration and credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Not Found

```bash
"Check if there's a dlt pipeline in the current directory.
If not, help me initialize a new pipeline."
```

### Destination Connection Issues

```bash
"Verify the destination connection and credentials for my pipeline.
Test the connection and report any issues."
```

### Schema Inference Problems

<Check>
  **Verification Steps:**
  - dlt MCP is installed via [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp)
  - Pipeline directory is accessible
  - Destination database credentials are configured
  - Pipeline has been run at least once
</Check>
