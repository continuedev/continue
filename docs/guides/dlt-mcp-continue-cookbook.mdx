  the dlt MCP and optimized data pipeline workflows for more consistent results. You can [remix this agent](/guides/understanding-agents#how-to-get-started-with-hub-agents) to customize it for your specific needs.
</Card>


After ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Load the Pre-Built Agent">
        Navigate to your pipeline project directory and run:
        ```bash
        cn --config dlthub/dlt-assistant
        ```

        This agent includes:
        - **dlt MCP** pre-configured and ready to use
        - **Pipeline-focused rules** for data engineering best practices
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Your First Pipeline Inspection">
        Start with a comprehensive pipeline check:
        ```bash
        # TUI mode
        Inspect the execution of my dlt pipeline and summarize the load info, including timing and file sizes.
        ```

        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **Why Use the Agent?** The pre-built [dlt Assistant agent](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-assistant) provides consistent pipeline development workflows and handles MCP configuration automatically, making it easier to get started with AI-powered data engineering. You can [remix and customize this agent](/guides/understanding-agents#how-to-get-started-with-hub-agents) later to fit your team's specific workflow.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🛠️ Manual Setup">
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent via the Continue Hub">
    Go to the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=agent).
    </Step>

  <Step title="Connect dlt MCP via Continue Hub">
    Visit the [dlt MCP on Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp) and click **Install** to add it to the agent you created in the step above.

    This will add dlt MCP to your agent's available tools. The Hub listing automatically configures the MCP command.

## dlt MCP vs dlt+ MCP

<Card title="Understanding the Difference" icon="info-circle">
  **dlt MCP** is focused on local pipeline development and inspection. It provides tools to:
  - Inspect pipeline execution and load information
  - Retrieve schema metadata from your local pipelines
  - Query dataset records from destination databases
  - Analyze load errors, timings, and file sizes

  **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** extends these capabilities with cloud-based features for production deployments:
  - Connect to dlt+ Projects and manage deployments
  - Monitor pipeline runs across multiple environments
  - Access centralized logging and observability
  - Collaborate with team members on pipeline development

  For local development and getting started, **[dlt MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp)** is the right choice. Consider **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** when you need production deployment features and team collaboration.

## Pipeline Development Recipes

Now you can use natural language prompts to develop and debug your dlt pipelines. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate dlt MCP tools.

<Info>
You can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Where to run these workflows:**
  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs
  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts
  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p "your prompt"` for headless commands

  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running pipeline operations that might make
  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode
  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This
  shows you what the agent will do without executing it.
