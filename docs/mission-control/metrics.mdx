<Info>
Metrics provides Agent observability for Cloud Agents and automated workflows. Agent observability answers a simple question: *What are my AI agents doing, and is it working?* Use Metrics to monitor agent activity, understand human intervention, measure success rates, and evaluate the cost and impact of AI-driven work across your repositories.

## What Metrics Show About Your Cloud Agents

Continue’s Metrics give you **operational observability for AI agents**, similar to how traditional observability tools provide visibility into services, jobs, and pipelines.

Instead of logs and latency, agent observability focuses on:
- Runs and execution frequency  
- Success vs. human intervention  
- Pull request outcomes  
- Cost per run and per workflow  

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Agent Activity & Execution Volume">
    Understand **when and how often your agents run**.
    - See which Cloud Agents are running most often  
    - Spot spikes, trends, or recurring failures  
    - Monitor automated Workflows in production  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent Success & Outcome Metrics">
    Measure **whether agents produce usable results**.
    - **Total runs**  
    - **PR creation rate**  
    - **PR status** (open, merged, closed, failed)  
    - **Success vs. intervention rate**  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow Reliability & Impact">
    Evaluate **automated agent workflows in production**.
    - Which Workflows generate the most work  
    - Completion and success rates  
    - Signals that a Workflow needs refinement or guardrails  
  </Accordion>

## Sharing Cloud Agent Metrics

Share your metrics with stakeholders, team members, or external collaborators using shareable snapshot links by clicking the **Share** button on your metrics page.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Point-in-Time Snapshots">
    When you create a share link, Continue captures a snapshot of your metrics data at that moment. The shared view displays:
    - Summary stats (total runs, merge rate, active agents)
    - Activity calendar showing run history
    - Activity by agent chart
    - Merge rate trend chart
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Authentication Required">
    Anyone with the share link can view the metrics snapshot without logging in. This makes it easy to share with stakeholders who don't have Continue accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic Expiration">
    Share links expire after 30 days by default. The expiration date is shown at the bottom of the shared view. After expiration, the link will no longer work.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Shared metrics are read-only snapshots. They don't update when your live metrics change—create a new share link to share updated data.
