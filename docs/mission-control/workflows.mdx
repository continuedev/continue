  What is a Workflow?

  A Workflow automatically runs an Agent on a repository when:
  - A schedule is reached (cron)
  - An event occurs (webhook, e.g. GitHub PR)

  Use Workflows for recurring or event-driven tasks like:
  - Daily vulnerability scans
  - Weekly changelog generation
  - Reacting to new pull requests or Sentry alerts

## Creating a Workflow

<Steps>

  <Step title="Start from scratch or a template">

    In Mission Control → Workflows, create a [new workflow](https://continue.dev/workflows/new).
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Start with a Blank Workflow">
    Create a workflow from scratch by clicking Create Workflow.  
    You'll choose the repository, agent, trigger type, and schedule or webhook.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use a Workflow Template">
    Select any of the “Try these Workflows” cards such as:
    - _Update agents.md_
    - _Draft Changelog Updates_
    - _Solve Snyk Vulnerabilities_

    Templates preload the recommended agent and schedule so you can customize and run them quickly.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the Workflow">

    Give your Workflow a clear, descriptive name.

    Examples:
    - `Morning status check`
    - `Weekly changelog draft`
    - `Daily Snyk vulnerability scan`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Repository & Agent">

    Choose:

    - Repository – the codebase the Agent will run against  
    - Agent – the configured Agent (model, rules, tools, prompt) that should perform the work

    <Tip>
      Need a new Agent? Create one in [Mission Control → Agents](https://continue.dev/agents/new), then return to this screen.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Trigger Type">

    Pick how this Workflow should run:

    - Cron – run on a schedule (daily, weekly, hourly, custom)  
    - GitHub – run when GitHub events occur (PR opened, merged, issue opened, label added)
    - Webhook – run when an external system sends a request

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Trigger">

    <AccordionGroup>

      <Accordion title="Cron Workflow">

        For scheduled Workflows:

        1. Select Cron as the trigger type  
        2. Choose a schedule:
           - Common presets (e.g. weekdays at 9 AM UTC)
           - Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly
           - Or define a Custom expression  
        3. (Optional) Add additional instructions for this Workflow run in the text area.

        Example use cases:
        - Run a morning status check on your repo every weekday  
        - Refactor React components once per week  
        - Generate a weekly changelog from recent commits  

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="GitHub Trigger Workflow">

        For GitHub event-based Workflows:

        1. Select GitHub as the trigger type
        2. Choose your connected GitHub App installation
        3. Select the event type:
           - **PR opened** – triggers when a pull request is opened
           - **PR merged** – triggers when a pull request is merged
           - **Issue opened** – triggers when an issue is created
           - **Label added** – triggers when a specific label is added to a PR or issue

        **Re-run on new commits (PR opened only):**  
        When using the "PR opened" event type, enable **Re-run on new commits** to send a follow-up message to the active agent session whenever new commits are pushed to the PR. The agent receives commit details (SHA, message, author) and can continue working on the updated code without creating a duplicate session.

        Example use cases:
        - Run an Agent on every new pull request for automated review
        - Trigger code quality checks when PRs are opened
        - Keep agents updated on PR changes with the re-run option

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Webhook Workflow">

        For custom webhook-based Workflows:

        1. Select Webhook as the trigger type  
        2. (Optional) Set a Secret Header (e.g. `X-Webhook-Secret`)  
        3. (Optional) Set a Secret Value (token your external system must send)  

        You'll receive a webhook URL to call from:
        - CI/CD pipelines
        - Any external system that can send HTTP requests

        Example use cases:
        - Kick off a workflow when Snyk or Sentry detects an issue  
        - Integrate with custom internal tools

      </Accordion>

    </AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Workflow">

    Click Create Cron Workflow or Create Webhook Workflow, depending on your trigger type.

    Your Workflow will now appear in the Workflows list and begin running based on its configured schedule or events.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Monitoring Workflow Runs

Workflow runs show up just like Tasks:

- Each execution creates a Session  
- Workflows appear in your Inbox  
- You can open the detail view to see the summary, diff, and logs.
