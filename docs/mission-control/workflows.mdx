  What is a Cloud Agent Workflow?

  Mission Control Cloud Agents automatically run on a repository when:
  - A schedule is reached (cron)
  - An event occurs (webhook, GitHub trigger)

  Use Cloud Agents for recurring or event-driven tasks like:
  - Daily vulnerability scans
  - Weekly changelog generation
  - Reacting to new pull requests or Sentry alerts

## Creating a Cloud Agent Workflow

<Steps>

  <Step title="Start from scratch or a template">

    In Mission Control, create a [new agent](https://continue.dev/agents/new).
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Start with a Blank Agent">
    Create an agent from scratch by clicking Create Agent.  
    You'll choose the repository, agent, trigger type, and schedule or webhook.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use a Template">
    Select any of the “Try these Agent” cards such as:
    - _Update agents.md_
    - _Draft Changelog Updates_
    - _Solve Snyk Vulnerabilities_

    Templates preload the recommended agent and schedule so you can customize and run them quickly.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the Agent">

    Give your Agent a clear, descriptive name, especially if your team will be managing multiple agents.

    Examples:
    - `Morning status check`
    - `Weekly changelog draft`
    - `Daily Snyk vulnerability scan`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Repository & Type of Kickoff">

    Choose:

    - Repository – the codebase the Agent will run against  
    - Kickoff - whether or not the agent will run automatically on trigger or if it will be available for manual kickoff from the Mission Control UI. For example, you may want a docs agent to only run when manually kicked off on a PR, while a security agent should run automatically on a schedule.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Trigger Type">

    Pick how this Cloud Agent Workflow should run:

    - Cron – run on a schedule (daily, weekly, hourly, custom)  
    - Webhook – run when an external system sends a request 
    - GitHub Trigger – run when specific GitHub events occur (e.g. pull request opened, issue created)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Agent Workflow">

    Click Create Agent and now you'll be able to see, edit, and montitor it in your [Agents tab in Mission Control](https://continue.dev/agents).

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Monitoring Cloud Agent Runs

Agent runs show up just like Tasks:

- Each execution creates a Session where you can open the detail view to see the summary, diff, and logs.
- Any PR generated by the agent appears in your Inbox for review
- You can also see the agents work on PRs in the PR timeline and checks.
