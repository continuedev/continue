<Info>

  **What is a Task?**

  A Task is a unit of work that combines:
  - Your instructions
  - An agent's capabilities (model, rules, tools, prompt)
  - Your codebase (repository and branch)

  Tasks can be triggered manually, by events, or on a schedule, and can be assigned to anyone on your team for review.

## Creating and Running a Task

<Steps>

  <Step title="Choose an Agent">

    Select the **Agent** you want to use for this task.

    <Tip>

      Don't have an Agent yet? Create one in **[Mission Control → Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new)** before setting up your first task.

    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Your Repository">

    Pick the **repository** and **branch** the Agent branch off of.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe the Task">

    Add your user input — clear instructions for what you want the agent to accomplish.

    **Example prompts:**

    ```text
    Refactor unused React components and clean up imports
    ```

    ```text
    Add error handling to all API endpoints in the /api directory
    ```

    ```text
    Update README with installation instructions for the new CLI tool
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Task">

    Click the Submit button.

    The Agent will:
    - Analyze your repository and branch
    - Execute the task based on your input
    - Generate changes based on your task request
    - Create a detailed session log

    <Info>

      Task execution time varies based on complexity. You can monitor progress in your inbox.

  <Step title="Review Results">

    Each Task run creates a Session with complete traceability.
  
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Summary">

        A high-level explanation of:
        - What the Agent did
        - Why decisions were made
        - Key changes implemented

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Diff">

        The exact code changes:
            - Files modified
            - Lines added/removed
            - Side-by-side comparison

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Logs">

        Full execution trace:
            - Tool calls made
            - Agent reasoning
            - Any errors or warnings

      </Accordion>

    </AccordionGroup>


    <Tip>

      Review the diff carefully before accepting changes. You can:
      - Accept all changes
      - Request modifications
      - Reject and retry with an updated input

    </Tip>

  </Step>
