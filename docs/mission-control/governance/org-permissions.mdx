## Organization Configs

When working with organizations, it's important to understand how configs work:

### Personal Org Configs

When you select an organization in your IDE, Continue uses **your personal config within that organization**. Each user has their own config per organization, allowing individual customization while still being part of the team.

### Organization Default Configs

Organization admins can configure **org-wide default configs** that apply to all users in the organization. These settings can be managed through the Organization Settings page.

To access Organization Settings as an admin:
1. Click the organization selector in your IDE
2. Select your organization
3. Click "Configure org default configs (all users)" in the dropdown

This allows admins to set baseline configurations that ensure consistency across the team while still allowing individual users to customize their personal configs.
