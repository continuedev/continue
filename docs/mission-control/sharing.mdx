<Info>
You can share any Agent or Component (Models, Rules, Prompts, MCP Servers) by publishing it as Public or Organization-visible.  
Sharing makes it easy for teammates—or the entire community—to reuse your best workflows.

## Where to Find Your Shareable Items

Your personal and organization components live in your Profile.

To access your profile (or your organization’s profile):

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Mission Control">
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Organization Switcher in the top left sidebar nav">
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Profile Icon">
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Note>
Profiles look the same for personal users and organizations. The only difference is visibility options: personal profiles can create *Public* or *Private* items. Organizations can also create *Organization-only* items.
</Note>

## Sharing Options

Each Agent or Component can be published with one of three visibility levels:
