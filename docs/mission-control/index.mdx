## What You Can Do in Mission Control

Mission Control is where developers and teams use Continue to power everyday coding workflows. From quick one-off Tasks to fully automated pipelines, everything starts here.

## Inbox: One Place to Triage, Assign, and Take Action

<Info>
The Inbox is your team's central queue for all AI-powered Tasks, agent activity, and first-class integrations like Sentry and Snyk. It gives developers a shared place to review work, delegate responsibility, and launch follow-up Tasks—all without leaving Mission Control.

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Unified View" icon="list">
    See every incoming Task, Sentry alert, Snyk vulnerability, and workflow output in one place.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Powerful Filtering" icon="filter">
    Slice the Inbox by Agent, repository, integration, creator, status, or time to surface what matters now.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clear Ownership" icon="user-check">
    Assign Sessions to teammates so responsibilities are explicit and reviews move forward.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Take Action Fast" icon="zap">
    Launch follow-up Tasks, investigate errors, or generate fixes directly from the Inbox—no context switching.
  </Card>

### First-Class Integration Tabs

Some signals deserve their own dedicated view. When you connect integrations:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Sentry">
  See error events organized by project with occurrences, first/last seen timestamps, and one-click **Solve** actions that launch an Agent to investigate or generate a fix.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Snyk">
  Review high-severity vulnerabilities, check CVSS scores, and trigger Agents to patch or upgrade dependencies.
</Accordion>

## Components Behind Mission Control

Mission Control uses your configured components to power Agents, Tasks, and Workflows:
Agents are built from reusable components that you can create, share, and customize:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Models" icon="cube">

    Large Language Models from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) configured for specific roles like chat, autocomplete, or editing

  </Card>

  <Card title="MCPs" icon="wrench">

    Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities like database access, web search, or custom functions

  </Card>

  <Card title="Rules" icon="shield">

    Guidelines that shape AI behavior - coding standards, constraints, or specific instructions for your domain

  </Card>

  <Card title="Prompts" icon="message-square">

    Reusable instructions for common tasks, optimized for specific workflows or coding patterns

  </Card>

</CardGroup>

<Tip>

  Components are the building blocks for agents that you can create new or remix from an existing component. When you create a component in mission control, it becomes available according to the permissions you set: Personal, Public, or Organization.

</Tip>


<Accordion title="Component Inputs">

Some components can receive values, including secrets, as inputs through templating. For values that the user needs to set, you can use template variables (e.g. `${{ inputs.API_KEY}}`). Then, the user can set `API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}` in the `with` clause of their agent or config.

<Info>
**Choosing between `secrets.` and `inputs.`**

When creating components for your Agent:
- Use `${{ inputs.INPUT_NAME }}` in your definition when you want users to be able to customize which secret is used
- Users will then map their own secrets using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the `with` clause

For personal or single-use configurations, you can skip the inputs layer and reference `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` directly.
