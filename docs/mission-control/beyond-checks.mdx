title: "Beyond Checks"
---

Checks review every pull request automatically. But pull requests are just one trigger. Continue can also run agents on schedules, in response to events like new issues, Sentry alerts, or Slack messages.

## Agents

Agents use the same markdown file format as checks. The difference: agents can be triggered by events beyond PR open — schedules, new issues, CI failures, webhooks, and more. Triggers are configured in the [Mission Control UI](https://continue.dev).

### Checks vs. agents

| | Checks | Agents |
|---|---|---|
| File location | `.continue/checks/` | `.continue/agents/` or continue.dev |
| Trigger | Always on PR open | Configurable in Mission Control |
| Purpose | Pass/fail review of PRs | Any automated task |
