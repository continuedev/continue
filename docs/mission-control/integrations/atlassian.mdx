## Official Workflow Templates

The following **official workflow template** is maintained by the Continue team and is available directly in the Mission Control Hub. This workflow is designed to work out of the box and represents the recommended way to automate Atlassian-based updates.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Update Jira Tickets with Cloud Agents" icon="ticket">
    Automatically translate merged pull requests into clear, business-friendly Jira updates that explain what changed, why it matters, and who benefits.

</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Official workflow templates may expand over time as new patterns are validated. You can view, enable, and configure this workflow in **[Mission Control → Integrations → Atlassian](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations/atlassian)**.
