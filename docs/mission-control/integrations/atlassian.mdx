## Overview

Connect Jira, Confluence, and Compass to Continue Mission Control to enable agents to manage issues, search tickets, summarize pages, and bulk-process tasks using natural language. When Atlassian is enabled, Continue can automatically translate technical code changes into business-friendly updates, keeping stakeholders informed.

 ## Workflows

### Update Jira Tickets

**Trigger**: On PR merge  
**Description**: Connect Jira, Confluence, and Compass to your agents. Search issues, create tickets, summarize pages, and bulk-process tasks with natural language.

When a pull request is merged, this workflow automatically:

1. **Extracts Jira Ticket ID** - Finds the ticket reference from:
   - PR title (e.g., `[PROJ-123] Add feature`)
   - Branch name (e.g., `feature/PROJ-123-description`)
   - PR description or comments

2. **Analyzes Code Changes** - Reviews the merged PR to identify:
   - What changed (files, features, components)
   - Why it matters (business value, problem solved)
   - Impact (user-facing changes, performance improvements)
   - Risk level (Low/Medium/High based on scope)

3. **Creates Business Summary** - Translates technical changes into clear, non-technical language:
   - Focuses on **outcomes over implementation**
   - Highlights **business value** and user benefits
   - Uses **plain language** avoiding technical jargon
   - Explains who benefits and how

4. **Updates Jira Ticket** - Posts a formatted comment with:
   - Business-friendly summary of what was accomplished
   - Key changes in business terms
   - Impact on users or stakeholders
   - Technical metadata (files changed, merge details, PR link)

5. **Comments on PR** - Adds a link back to the updated Jira ticket

<Card title="Why This Matters" icon="users">

  Technical code changes are often difficult for stakeholders to understand. This workflow bridges the gap between development and business by:
  - Keeping product managers informed without technical details
  - Providing business stakeholders with clear progress updates
  - Reducing manual ticket updates for developers
  - Creating a clear audit trail of work completed

</Card>

<Info>

  **Smart Translation**: The agent automatically converts technical terms into business language. For example, "Refactored authentication module" becomes "Users can now stay logged in longer without interruptions."

</Info>

## Use Cases

You can also create your own Atlassian-connected agents in Mission Control. Here are some examples for these use cases:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="Issue Creator Agent" icon="ticket">

  **Task Example**: "Create Jira tickets for all TODO comments in the codebase with priority based on code location"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Scans codebase for TODO and FIXME comments
  - Creates Jira issues with relevant context
  - Links issues to code files and line numbers
  - Assigns priority based on file criticality

  **Run in Mission Control**: Schedule weekly or after major releases

</Card>


Streamline sprint planning with intelligent automation:

<Card title="Sprint Planner Agent" icon="calendar-days">

  **Task Example**: "Analyze backlog items and create a proposed sprint plan based on team velocity and priorities"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Reviews open Jira issues and their estimates
  - Considers team capacity and historical velocity
  - Groups related tickets together
  - Creates a proposed sprint with balanced workload

  **Run in Mission Control**: Run before sprint planning meetings

</Card>

<Card title="Docs Sync Agent" icon="book-open">

  **Task Example**: "Update Confluence API documentation to match current OpenAPI spec"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Parses API specifications from codebase
  - Compares with existing Confluence documentation
  - Updates or creates Confluence pages with changes
  - Notifies team of significant API changes

  **Run in Mission Control**: Trigger on API spec changes or schedule weekly

</Card>

<Card title="Release Notes Agent" icon="megaphone">

  **Task Example**: "Generate release notes from closed Jira tickets since last release and publish to Confluence"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Queries Jira for tickets closed since last release
  - Categorizes changes (features, fixes, improvements)
  - Generates formatted release notes
  - Creates or updates Confluence release page

  **Run in Mission Control**: Trigger manually before releases

</Card>

<Card title="Project Health Agent" icon="chart-line">

  **Task Example**: "Analyze current sprint progress and identify blocked or at-risk items"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Reviews sprint board status
  - Identifies tickets without recent updates
  - Flags dependencies and blockers
  - Generates summary report in Confluence

  **Run in Mission Control**: Schedule daily during active sprints

</Card>

## Running Atlassian Agents in Mission Control
You can run Supabase-connected agents in two ways as [one-off tasks](../tasks) or automated [workflows](../workflows):


<Tip>

  Start with manual tasks to refine your content queries, then automate repetitive content management and validation tasks.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Authentication failures">

  **Problem**: Agent can't connect to Atlassian services

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify API token hasn't expired
  - Check that email matches the token's account
  - Ensure domain includes `.atlassian.net`
  - Regenerate token if necessary

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied errors">

  **Problem**: Agent can't create or update items

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify your Atlassian account has appropriate permissions
  - Check project-level permissions in Jira
  - Ensure space permissions are correct in Confluence
  - Contact your Atlassian admin if needed

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issues not found or accessible">

  **Problem**: Agent reports Jira issues don't exist

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify issue keys are correct (e.g., PROJECT-123)
  - Check that you have access to the project
  - Ensure issues aren't in a restricted project
  - Verify your API token has read access

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Confluence pages not updating">

  **Problem**: Documentation changes aren't reflected in Confluence

  **Solutions**:
  - Check that you have edit permissions for the space
  - Verify page IDs are correct
  - Ensure Confluence Cloud API is accessible
  - Review agent logs for specific error messages

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate limiting errors">

  **Problem**: Agent hits Atlassian API rate limits

  **Solutions**:
  - Reduce frequency of automated workflows
  - Batch operations where possible
  - Implement exponential backoff in agent logic
  - Consider upgrading Atlassian plan for higher limits
