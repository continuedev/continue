The Atlassian integration connects Jira and Confluence to Mission Control so agents can update tickets, reference documentation, and keep project tracking in sync with code changes.

[Connect Atlassian in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/atlassian)

## Access and permissions

When connecting Atlassian, you authorize Continue to access Jira and Confluence based on your account permissions. Agents can only access projects and spaces you have permission to view or edit.

Approved permissions allow agents to read and update Jira tickets, reference Confluence pages, and create links back to related pull requests. You can revoke access at any time from Mission Control.

## Automation examples

### Update Jira on PR merge

Trigger an agent on `PR Merged` to translate the code changes into a business-friendly Jira update — what changed, why it matters, and which tickets to close or transition.

### Create tickets from code

An agent can scan for `TODO` comments, failing tests, or opened issues and create corresponding Jira tickets with relevant context from the codebase.

For more patterns, see the [Atlassian cookbook](/guides/atlassian-mcp-continue-cookbook).
