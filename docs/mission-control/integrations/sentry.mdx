## Access & Permissions

When connecting Sentry, you’ll authorize Continue to receive error events and access issue data.

- **Project and issue access**  
  Agents can access Sentry projects and issues you have permission to view within your organization.

- **Permissions**  
  Approved permissions allow Continue to analyze error events, read issue details, and create pull requests or GitHub issues on your behalf.


You can update or revoke access at any time from Sentry or the Mission Control Hub.

<Info>
  Connecting Sentry requires creating an **[internal integration](https://sentry.io/settings/developer-settings/new-internal/)** in your Sentry organization.  
  
  You’ll be asked for your organization slug and credentials that allow Continue to receive issue and event data via webhooks and API access.
  
  Full credential setup is handled in the Mission Control Hub.
