## Overview

Connect Sentry to Continue Mission Control to enable agents to automatically detect, analyze, and resolve production errors. When Sentry is enabled, Continue can generate PRs to fix issues, analyze error patterns, and maintain application health.

<Card title="What You Can Do with Sentry Integration" icon="shield-exclamation">

  - Automatically generate PRs to resolve new errors
  - Analyze error patterns and identify root causes
  - Prioritize issues based on impact and frequency
  - Create detailed bug reports with stack traces
  - Monitor error trends across releases

</Card>

## Setup

<Steps>

  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">

    Go to your [Integrations Settings](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Sentry">

    Click "Connect" and select Sentry. You'll need the following credentials:

    - **Sentry Organization Slug**: Your organization name (e.g., "my-company")
    - **Auth Token**: Internal integration token from Sentry
    - **Client Secret**: For webhook signature verification

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Sentry Internal Integration">

    In your Sentry account:
    1. Create a new [internal integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/)
    2. Set the webhook URL to `https://api.continue.dev/webhooks/sentry`
    3. Select "Read and Write" access for "Issue and Event"
    4. Select "issue" in the webhooks section and click Save Changes
    5. Copy the Auth Token and Client Secret

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Credentials to Mission Control">

    Paste all three values into the integration form and click "Create Connection"

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>

  **How to get these credentials:**
  1. Create a new **internal integration** in Sentry
  2. Set the webhook URL to `https://api.continue.dev/webhooks/sentry`
  3. Select "Read and Write" access for "Issue and Event"
  4. Select "issue" in the webhooks section and click Save Changes
  5. Find your organization slug in the Sentry URL (your-slug.sentry.io)
  6. Copy the Auth Token and Client Secret from the integration

</Tip>

## Running Sentry Agents in Mission Control

You can run Sentry-connected agents in two ways as [one-off tasks](../tasks) or automated [workflows](../workflows).

<Tip>

  Start with manual tasks to refine your content queries, then automate repetitive content management and validation tasks.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Webhooks not triggering">

  **Problem**: Agent isn't running when new errors occur

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify webhook URL is correct in Sentry
  - Check that "issue" is selected in webhook events
  - Ensure Client Secret matches in both Sentry and Mission Control
  - Review webhook delivery logs in Sentry

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent can't access Sentry data">

  **Problem**: Agent returns errors when trying to fetch issue details

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify Auth Token has "Read and Write" access for "Issue and Event"
  - Check that organization slug is correct
  - Ensure token hasn't expired
  - Confirm project permissions in Sentry

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PRs not linking to Sentry issues">

  **Problem**: Generated PRs don't reference the Sentry issue

  **Solutions**:
  - Ensure both Sentry and GitHub integrations are connected
  - Verify agent has permission to access both services
  - Check that the agent prompt includes instructions to link issues
  - Review agent logs for errors
