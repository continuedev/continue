The Sentry integration connects your error monitoring to Mission Control so agents can analyze production errors as they occur and open pull requests with fixes.

[Connect Sentry in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/sentry)

## Access and permissions

Connecting Sentry requires creating an [internal integration](https://sentry.io/settings/developer-settings/new-internal/) in your Sentry organization. You'll provide your organization slug and credentials during setup in Mission Control.

Agents can access projects and issues you have permission to view. Approved permissions allow Continue to analyze error events, read issue details, and create pull requests or GitHub issues on your behalf.

You can revoke access at any time from Sentry or Mission Control.

## Automation examples

### Auto-fix errors

When Sentry detects a new issue, an agent analyzes the stack trace, investigates recent code changes, and opens a PR with a fix.

### Triage by severity

Configure an agent to only act on high-frequency or high-impact errors, routing different error types to specialized agents or creating GitHub issues for manual review.
