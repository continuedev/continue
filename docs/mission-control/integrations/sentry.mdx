<Card title="Performance Watcher Agent" icon="gauge-high">

  **Task Example**: "Identify performance regressions from Sentry performance monitoring and suggest optimizations"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Analyzes transaction duration trends
  - Identifies slow database queries or API calls
  - Detects N+1 query problems
  - Suggests code optimizations
  - Creates PRs with performance improvements

  **Run in Mission Control**: Schedule daily or trigger on performance alerts

</Card>

### User Impact Analysis

Understand how errors affect your users:

<Card title="Impact Analyzer Agent" icon="users">

  **Task Example**: "Generate a report on which users are most affected by current errors and prioritize fixes accordingly"

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Identifies users experiencing multiple errors
  - Analyzes error distribution across user segments
  - Correlates errors with user churn or frustration signals
  - Creates prioritized fix lists based on user impact
  - Generates customer communication templates

  **Run in Mission Control**: Run weekly or before customer check-ins

</Card>

## Running Sentry Agents in Mission Control

You can run Sentry-connected agents in two ways:

### 1. Manual Tasks

Trigger agents on-demand for error analysis:

1. Go to [Mission Control Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents)
2. Select or create a Sentry-enabled agent
3. Click "Run Agent" and provide your task description
4. Monitor progress and review results in real-time

**Example Tasks:**
- "Analyze the top 10 errors from the last 24 hours"
- "Create a PR to fix the authentication timeout error"
- "Generate a report on errors affecting mobile users"

### 2. Automated Workflows

Set up agents to run automatically:

- **Webhook-triggered**: Execute when new Sentry errors occur
- **Scheduled**: Run daily or weekly error analysis
- **Threshold-based**: Trigger when error rates exceed limits

<Tip>

  Start with manual tasks to refine your prompts, then convert successful workflows to automations for continuous error monitoring.

</Tip>

## Example Agent Configurations

### Sentry Error Resolution Agent

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create Agent">

    Visit [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and create a new agent with:
    - **Name**: Sentry Error Resolver
    - **Tools**: Enable Sentry MCP
    - **Prompt**: "Monitor and resolve production errors automatically"
    - **Rules**: Add error handling and testing standards

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Sentry Connection">

    Ensure your Sentry integration is connected with the proper organization slug and auth token.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Automation">

    Create an automation that:
    - Triggers on new Sentry error webhooks
    - Analyzes the error and generates a fix
    - Creates a PR with tests
    - Links back to the Sentry issue

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with Manual Run">

    Before enabling automation, test with manual tasks:
    - "Fix the TypeError in user authentication"
    - "Analyze errors from the checkout flow"
    - "Create a report on database query timeouts"

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Error Resolution

<Card title="Effective Error Fixing" icon="lightbulb">

  **Do:**
  - Provide specific error IDs or URLs from Sentry
  - Include reproduction steps in your prompts
  - Ask for test coverage with the fix
  - Review generated PRs before merging

  **Don't:**
  - Auto-merge fixes without review
  - Fix errors without understanding root cause
  - Ignore patterns in favor of one-off fixes

</Card>

### Prompt Examples

**Good prompts provide context:**
- ✅ "Fix Sentry issue #12345: TypeError in payment processing. Users report this happens during checkout when using saved cards."
- ✅ "Analyze the 10 most frequent errors this week and create GitHub issues for any that affect >100 users."

**Poor prompts lack specificity:**
- ❌ "Fix errors"
- ❌ "Check Sentry"

## Integration with GitHub

Combine Sentry with GitHub integration for a complete workflow:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect Both Integrations">

    Enable both Sentry and GitHub integrations in Mission Control

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Unified Agent">

    Build an agent that:
    - Receives Sentry error notifications
    - Analyzes the error and finds the problematic code
    - Creates a PR with a fix
    - Adds the PR link to the Sentry issue

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Automated Workflow">

    Configure the agent to run automatically on new Sentry issues

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Monitoring Agent Activity

Track your agent's error resolution performance:

1. **View in Mission Control**: See all agent runs and their outcomes
2. **Check Sentry**: Verify that issues are being resolved
3. **Review PRs**: Ensure quality of generated fixes
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Track resolution time and success rate

## Disconnecting Sentry

To remove the Sentry integration:

1. Go to [Integrations Settings](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Find your Sentry integration
3. Click "Disconnect"
4. Remove the webhook from your Sentry internal integration

<Warning>

  Disconnecting Sentry will prevent agents from receiving error notifications and accessing error data. Any running agents with Sentry tasks will fail.

</Warning>

## Security & Privacy

- Continue only accesses error data for configured projects
- All API calls are authenticated and encrypted
- Webhook signatures are verified for security
- You can revoke access at any time
- Error data is not stored; it's only accessed on-demand

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Webhooks not triggering">

  **Problem**: Agent isn't running when new errors occur

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify webhook URL is correct in Sentry
  - Check that "issue" is selected in webhook events
  - Ensure Client Secret matches in both Sentry and Mission Control
  - Review webhook delivery logs in Sentry

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent can't access Sentry data">

  **Problem**: Agent returns errors when trying to fetch issue details

  **Solutions**:
  - Verify Auth Token has "Read and Write" access for "Issue and Event"
  - Check that organization slug is correct
  - Ensure token hasn't expired
