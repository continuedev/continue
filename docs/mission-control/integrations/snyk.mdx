## Use Cases

### Code Vulnerability Scanning (SAST)

Scan your source code for security vulnerabilities:

<Card title="Code Security Agent" icon="code">

  **Task Example**: "Run a Snyk Code scan on this repo with severity threshold medium. Summarize issues with file:line locations and propose minimal fixes for the top 3 critical issues."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Performs static application security testing on your code
  - Identifies security vulnerabilities with exact file and line numbers
  - Prioritizes issues by severity and exploitability
  - Generates minimal, targeted fixes for critical issues
  - Re-runs scans to verify fixes resolve the vulnerabilities

  **Run in Mission Control**: Set up as pre-commit hook or PR check

</Card>

### Dependency Scanning (SCA)

Check open source dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

<Card title="Dependency Security Agent" icon="cube">

  **Task Example**: "Run Snyk Open Source scan including dev dependencies. Summarize vulnerable dependency paths and propose a minimal-risk upgrade plan."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Performs software composition analysis on all dependencies
  - Maps vulnerability paths through dependency tree
  - Identifies minimal-risk upgrade strategies
  - Creates dependency update plans with compatibility checks
  - Re-tests after proposed changes to confirm resolution

  **Run in Mission Control**: Schedule weekly or trigger on package updates

</Card>

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes configs:

<Card title="IaC Security Agent" icon="cloud">

  **Task Example**: "Scan ./infra directory with Snyk IaC. Report high/critical misconfigurations with exact files and lines. Provide corrected configurations."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Scans infrastructure code for security misconfigurations
  - Identifies exposed secrets and overly permissive policies
  - Reports exact file locations and line numbers
  - Provides secure configuration alternatives
  - Re-scans to confirm misconfigurations are resolved

  **Run in Mission Control**: Run before infrastructure deployments

</Card>

### Container Security Scanning

Analyze Docker images for vulnerabilities:

<Card title="Container Security Agent" icon="docker">

  **Task Example**: "Scan Docker image my-api:latest excluding base image vulnerabilities. Show dependency tree and recommend safer base images."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Scans container images for OS and application vulnerabilities
  - Analyzes complete dependency tree in containers
  - Recommends security-hardened base images
  - Creates optimized Dockerfiles with security improvements
  - Re-tests after changes to verify vulnerability reduction

  **Run in Mission Control**: Trigger on container builds or before deployments

</Card>

### Pull Request Security Scanning

Focus scanning on modified files:

<Card title="PR Security Agent" icon="code-branch">

  **Task Example**: "Scan only files changed since origin/main with Snyk Code. Block if new high severity issues would be introduced."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Targets security scanning to changed files only
  - Compares security posture before and after changes
  - Identifies newly introduced vulnerabilities
  - Shows security impact delta for the PR
  - Blocks merge if critical issues are detected

  **Run in Mission Control**: Set up as PR check automation

</Card>

### Security Learning Integration

Access contextual security education:

<Card title="Security Education Agent" icon="graduation-cap">

  **Task Example**: "Open Snyk Learn lessons related to the top CWE vulnerabilities from this scan."

  **What the Agent Does**:
  - Maps vulnerabilities to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories
  - Retrieves relevant Snyk Learn educational content
  - Provides contextual security training based on actual issues
  - Links to remediation guides and best practices
  - Tracks security knowledge gaps across the team

  **Run in Mission Control**: Run after security scans for team education

</Card>

## Running Snyk Agents in Mission Control

You can run Snyk-connected agents in two ways:

### 1. Manual Tasks

Trigger agents on-demand for vulnerability analysis:

1. Go to [Mission Control Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents)
2. Select or create a Snyk-enabled agent
3. Click "Run Agent" and provide your task description
4. Monitor progress and review results in real-time

**Example Tasks:**
- "Scan all projects for critical vulnerabilities and prioritize fixes"
- "Update all npm dependencies with known vulnerabilities"
- "Generate a security report for the last sprint"

### 2. Automated Workflows

Set up agents to run automatically:

- **Webhook-triggered**: Execute when new vulnerabilities are detected
- **Scheduled**: Run daily or weekly security scans
- **PR-triggered**: Scan new dependencies before merge

<Tip>

  Start with manual tasks to understand your vulnerability patterns, then automate the most common remediation workflows for continuous security.

</Tip>

## Integration with GitHub

Combine Snyk with GitHub integration for a complete security workflow:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect Both Integrations">

    Enable both Snyk and GitHub integrations in Mission Control

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Security Agent">

    Build an agent that:
    - Receives Snyk vulnerability alerts
    - Analyzes the security issue in your codebase
    - Creates a PR with the security fix
    - Adds security impact analysis to the PR

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Automated Security Workflow">

    Configure the agent to run automatically on new critical vulnerabilities

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Monitoring Agent Activity

Track your agent's security remediation performance:

1. **View in Inbox**: Navigate to the [Snyk view](https://hub.continue.dev/inbox?view=snyk) to see all Snyk-related agent activity
2. **Check Snyk Dashboard**: Verify that vulnerabilities are being addressed
3. **Review PRs**: Ensure quality and security of generated fixes
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Track mean time to remediation (MTTR) and fix rate
