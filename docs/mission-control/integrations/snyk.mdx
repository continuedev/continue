The Snyk integration connects your security scanning to Mission Control so agents can detect vulnerabilities and open pull requests with fixes.

[Connect Snyk in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/snyk)

## Access and permissions

When connecting Snyk, you authorize Continue via OAuth. Agents can only access projects you have permission to view within your organization.

Approved permissions allow agents to read vulnerability findings and create remediation pull requests. You can revoke access at any time from Snyk or Mission Control.

## Auto-remediation

When Snyk detects high or critical vulnerabilities, an agent analyzes the findings, generates a fix, and opens a PR. You can scope this to specific projects or severity levels in your agent settings.

For more patterns, see the [Snyk cookbook](/guides/snyk-mcp-continue-cookbook).
