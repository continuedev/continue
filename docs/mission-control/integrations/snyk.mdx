## Official Workflow Templates for Snyk Cloud Agents in Continue

The following **official workflow template** is maintained by the Continue team and is available directly in the Mission Control Hub. This workflow is designed to work out of the box and represents the recommended way to automate Snyk-based remediation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Auto-fix Snyk Vulnerabilities" icon="shield-check">
    Automatically remediate high and critical security vulnerabilities detected by Snyk.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Official workflow templates may expand over time as new security patterns are validated. You can view, enable, and configure these workflows in **[Mission Control → Integrations → Snyk](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations/snyk)**.
