## Usage

To kick off an agent, mention `@Continue` with a short task description.

### Thread Context

When you mention `@Continue` in a **Slack thread**, Continue automatically uses the entire conversation as context. This means your agent starts with full situational awareness.

If you start a **new message** (not a reply), Continue only sees that single message for context.  
Use this for quick standalone requests.

<Tip>

  Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:

  ✅ **Good**: `@Continue Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`

  ❌ **Poor**: `@Continue fix auth`

</Tip>

<Accordion title="Repository Selection">

  Continue determines which repository to work in with the following precedence:

  1. **Specify in message**: Add `repo=repo-name` to your message:

  ```
  @Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug
  ```

  <Tip>

    Be sure the repository name matches a GitHub repository that the Continue GitHub App has access to.

  </Tip>

  2. **Default repo**: Uses the default repository if set in the integration settings

  3. **Interactive selection**: If no repository is found, Continue will follow up with a dropdown to select a repository

</Accordion>

### Sending Follow-up Messages

Once an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread:

```
@Continue Also add error handling for edge cases
```

Continue will forward your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one. 

## Monitoring Agent Progress

Click the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/agents).

You can also click the Slack icon in the agents page to return to the Slack message.

## Disconnecting

To remove the Slack integration:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Find your Slack integration
3. Click "Disconnect"
