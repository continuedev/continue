The Slack integration lets you start agents directly from Slack by mentioning `@Continue`.

[Connect Slack in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/slack)

The Slack app is currently in beta and undergoing Slack's approval process.

## Starting an agent

Mention `@Continue` with a task description in any channel or thread:

```
@Continue Fix the authentication timeout in /api/v1/auth/login — users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.
```

When mentioned in a thread, the agent uses the full conversation as context. In a new message (not a reply), it only sees that single message.

## Repository selection

The agent determines which repository to work in using this precedence:

1. **Explicit**: add `repo=your-repo` to your message — `@Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug`
2. **Default**: uses the default repository from your integration settings
3. **Interactive**: if no repository is found, the agent replies with a dropdown to select one

The repository name must match a GitHub repository the Continue GitHub App has access to.

## Follow-up messages

Once an agent is running, mention `@Continue` in the same thread to send follow-up instructions:

```
@Continue Also add error handling for the rate limit case
```

The message is forwarded to the existing agent session rather than creating a new one.

## Monitoring progress

Click the agent link posted in Slack to view progress in [Mission Control](https://continue.dev). You can also click the Slack icon on the agent's page to return to the original thread.

## Disconnecting

Remove your Slack connection from [continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://continue.dev/settings/integrations).
