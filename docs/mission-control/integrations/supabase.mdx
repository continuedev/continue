The Supabase integration connects your database to Mission Control so agents can audit Row Level Security (RLS) policies when pull requests touch database-related code.

[Connect Supabase in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/supabase)

## Access and permissions

When connecting Supabase, you select the organization and project to connect. Approved permissions allow agents to inspect RLS policies, generate migrations, and commit fixes to PR branches.

You can revoke access at any time from Supabase or Mission Control.

## RLS audits

Trigger an agent on `PR Opened` to audit RLS for tables referenced in the diff. The agent commits fixes directly to the PR branch and posts a summary comment.
