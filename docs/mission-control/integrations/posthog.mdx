## Official Workflow Templates

The following **official workflow template** is maintained by the Continue team and is available directly in the Mission Control Hub. This workflow is designed to work out of the box and represents the recommended way to automate PostHog updates.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Update PostHog Dashboards" icon="chart-bar">
    When a pull request is merged, this workflow updates PostHog dashboards and tracking to reflect newly shipped features or changes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Official workflow templates may expand over time as new analytics patterns are validated. You can view, enable, and configure this workflow in **[Mission Control → Integrations → PostHog](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations/posthog)**.

## Access & Permissions

When connecting PostHog, you’ll provide an API key that allows Continue to query analytics data and update dashboards.

  Cloud Agents can only access the PostHog project associated with the API key you provide.

You can rotate or revoke the API key at any time from your PostHog settings.
