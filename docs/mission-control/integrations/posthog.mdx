The PostHog integration connects your analytics to Mission Control so agents can update dashboards and tracking when code ships, keeping metrics aligned with what's actually in production.

[Connect PostHog in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/posthog)

## Access and permissions

When connecting PostHog, you provide an API key with permission to read analytics data and modify dashboards. Agents can only access the project associated with the key you provide.

PostHog supports both cloud-hosted and self-hosted instances. You'll need your project's API key and host URL when connecting.

You can rotate or revoke the key at any time from your PostHog settings.

## Dashboard sync

Trigger an agent on `PR Merged` to scan the diff for telemetry changes — new events, removed tracking calls, renamed properties — and update the corresponding PostHog dashboards automatically.
