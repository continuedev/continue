## Running PostHog Agents in Mission Control

You can run PostHog-connected agents in two ways:

### 1. Manual Tasks

Trigger agents on-demand for analytics insights:

1. Go to [Mission Control PostHog Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=agents&q=posthog)
2. Select or create a PostHog-enabled agent
3. Click "Run Agent" and provide your task description
4. Monitor progress and review results in real-time

**Example Tasks:**
- "What are the most common user paths leading to checkout abandonment?"
- "Compare mobile vs desktop conversion rates for the last month"
- "Identify features with low adoption that we should sunset"

### 2. Automated Workflows

Set up agents to run automatically:

- **Scheduled**: Run daily, weekly, or monthly analytics reviews
- **Metric-triggered**: Execute when KPIs cross thresholds
- **Event-based**: Trigger on feature flag changes or experiment completion

<Tip>

  Start with manual exploratory tasks to understand your data, then automate recurring analysis patterns with scheduled workflows.
