The Sanity integration connects your content platform to Mission Control so agents can validate schemas, run GROQ queries, and keep content documentation in sync with code changes.

[Connect Sanity in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/sanity)

## Access and permissions

When connecting Sanity, you authorize Continue to access your workspace based on your project permissions. Agents can only access projects and datasets you have permission to view.

Approved permissions allow agents to read schemas, run GROQ queries, and create or update documents. You can revoke access at any time from Mission Control.

## Schema documentation

Trigger an agent on `PR Opened` to detect schema changes in the diff and automatically update your Sanity content documentation to match.

For more patterns, see the [Sanity cookbook](/guides/sanity-mcp-continue-cookbook).
