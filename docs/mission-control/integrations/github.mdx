The GitHub integration connects your repositories to Mission Control so agents can read code, create pull requests, manage issues, and respond to repository events.

[Connect GitHub in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/github)

## Access and permissions

When connecting GitHub, you choose which repositories to grant access to and approve the requested permissions. These allow Continue to read repository data and open pull requests on your behalf.

You can change repository access or revoke the integration at any time from your GitHub settings or from Mission Control.

## Trigger events

Agents can run automatically in response to GitHub events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **PR Opened** | A new pull request is opened |
| **PR Merged** | A pull request is merged |
| **Label Added** | A label is added to an issue or PR |
| **Issue Opened** | A new issue is created |
| **PR Review Comment** | A review comment is added to a pull request |
| **Check Failed** | A CI check suite fails |

The agent receives a summary of the event appended to its prompt. For example, an agent triggered by `Issue Opened` sees:

```
Issue #123 was opened: Login page crashes on mobile devices
Issue URL: https://github.com/acme/webapp/issues/123
```

The full initial prompt for a task is visible in its logs.

## Automation examples

Combine trigger events with agent instructions to automate common patterns.

### Issue to PR

An agent watches for new issues (or a specific label like `agent:fix`) and opens pull requests automatically:

1. Issue is opened or labeled
2. Agent gathers context from the repo, issue thread, and relevant files
3. Agent implements changes on a branch
4. CI runs (tests, lint, security)
5. Agent opens a PR referencing the original issue

To restrict which repositories or issues agents act on, configure filters in your agent settings.

### PR review

Trigger on `PR Opened` to have an agent review incoming pull requests — checking for bugs, style violations, missing tests, or security concerns — and post comments directly on the PR.

### Auto-fix failing checks

Trigger on `Check Failed` with a label filter (e.g., `autofix`) so an agent only acts on failures you opt into. The agent reads the CI logs, pushes a fix to the branch, and lets CI re-run.
