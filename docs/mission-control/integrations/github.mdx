## Access & Permissions

When connecting GitHub, you’ll be asked to configure repository access and approve permissions.

- **Repository access**  
  Choose whether to grant access to all repositories or select specific ones. You can change this at any time in your GitHub settings.

- **Permissions**  
  Review and approve the requested permissions. These allow Continue to read repository data and perform automated actions like opening pull requests on your behalf.

You can revisit or revoke access at any time from GitHub or the Mission Control Hub.
