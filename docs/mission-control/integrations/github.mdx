<Tip>Official workflow templates may expand over time as new patterns are validated. You can view, enable, and configure these workflows in **[Mission Control → Integrations → GitHub](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations/github)**.</Tip>

## Workflow: GitHub issue → pull request (Cloud Agent)

**Problem**: GitHub issues pile up because turning an issue into a tested PR takes time and context switching.

**Solution**: Continue Mission Control Cloud Agents can watch issues (or be triggered by labels) and automatically open pull requests with code changes, tests, and a clear summary.

**Outcome**: Faster issue throughput, consistent PR quality, and an auditable trail from issue → commits → PR → CI results.

1. Trigger: issue opened or labeled (for example, `agent:fix`)
2. Agent gathers context: repo code + issue thread + relevant files
3. Agent implements the fix on a branch
4. Agent runs checks: tests/lint/security (your CI)
5. Agent opens a PR with:
   - summary of changes
   - test results / CI link
   - references the original issue (closes #123)
   - or whatever you specify in the agent instructions

## Advanced Use Cases
<Accordion title="Advanced: Custom GitHub Cloud Agent Workflow Ideas">
You can create custom workflows using Continue Cloud Agents to automate a variety of GitHub-related tasks. Here are some ideas to get you started:
  - Automatically triage new issues with labels and suggested assignees
  - Review pull requests for security or performance concerns
  - Draft documentation updates based on code changes
  - Detect deprecated APIs and open migration issues
  - Summarize repository activity for weekly team updates

## Access & Permissions

When connecting GitHub, you’ll be asked to configure repository access and approve permissions.

- **Repository access**  
  Choose whether to grant access to all repositories or select specific ones. You can change this at any time in your GitHub settings.

- **Permissions**  
  Review and approve the requested permissions. These allow Continue to read repository data and perform automated actions like opening pull requests on your behalf.

You can revisit or revoke access at any time from GitHub or the Mission Control Hub.

## FAQs
### Can Continue turn GitHub issues into ready-to-merge pull requests automatically?
Yes! You can set up workflows where Cloud Agents monitor issues (or specific labels) and create pull requests with code changes, tests, and summaries.

### How do I trigger an agent from a GitHub issue label?
You can configure a Cloud Agent that is triggered whenever an issue is labeled with a specific tag (e.g., `agent:fix`). The agent will then gather context and create a pull request based on the issue.

### Can the agent run tests and include results in the PR?
Continue's Cloud Agents can be configured to run your tests and include the results in the pull request summary.

### How do I restrict which repos/issues agents can act on?
You can configure repository and issue filters within your workflows to control where agents operate.
