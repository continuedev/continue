The GitHub integration connects your repositories to Mission Control so agents can read code, create pull requests, manage issues, and respond to repository events.

[Connect GitHub in Mission Control](https://continue.dev/integrations/github)

## Access and permissions

When connecting GitHub, you choose which repositories to grant access to and approve the requested permissions. These allow Continue to read repository data and open pull requests on your behalf.

You can change repository access or revoke the integration at any time from your GitHub settings or Mission Control.

## Trigger events

Workflows can run automatically in response to GitHub events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **PR Opened** | A new pull request is opened |
| **PR Merged** | A pull request is merged |
| **Label Added** | A label is added to an issue or PR |
| **Issue Opened** | A new issue is created |
| **PR Review Comment** | A review comment is added to a pull request |
| **Check Failed** | A CI check suite fails |

The agent receives a summary of the event appended to its prompt. For example, an agent triggered by `Issue Opened` sees:

```
Issue #123 was opened: Login page crashes on mobile devices
Issue URL: https://github.com/acme/webapp/issues/123
```

The full initial prompt for a task is visible in its logs.

## Workflow templates

These templates are maintained by the Continue team and available in [Mission Control](https://continue.dev/integrations/github):

- **Update AGENTS.md** — keeps your `AGENTS.md` file in sync with agents used in the repo
- **Draft Changelog Updates** — creates draft changelog entries from recent merged pull requests
- **Explain Codebase** — generates a high-level explanation of repository structure
- **Refactor React Components** — identifies and refactors large React components on a schedule
- **Improve Test Coverage** — makes incremental test coverage improvements on a recurring schedule

## Issue-to-PR automation

Agents can watch for new issues (or a specific label like `agent:fix`) and automatically open pull requests:

1. Issue is opened or labeled
2. Agent gathers context from the repo, issue thread, and relevant files
3. Agent implements changes on a branch
4. CI runs (tests, lint, security)
5. Agent opens a PR referencing the original issue

The PR content — summary, test results, issue references — is controlled by the agent's instructions. For a detailed walkthrough, see the [GitHub MCP Cookbook](/guides/github-mcp-continue-cookbook) or the [PR Review Bot guide](/guides/github-pr-review-bot).

You can also build custom workflows for other patterns: triaging issues with labels, reviewing PRs for security concerns, drafting documentation from code changes, detecting deprecated APIs, or summarizing weekly repository activity.

## FAQs

### Can agents create PRs from GitHub issues?

Configure a workflow with an `Issue Opened` or `Label Added` trigger. The agent gathers context and opens a pull request with code changes, tests, and a summary.

### How do I trigger an agent from an issue label?

Create a workflow with a `Label Added` trigger filtered to a specific tag (e.g., `agent:fix`).

### Can the agent run tests and include results in the PR?

Agents run your CI checks and can include results in the pull request summary.

### How do I restrict which repos or issues agents act on?

Configure repository and issue filters in your workflow settings.
