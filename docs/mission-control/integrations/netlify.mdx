The Netlify integration connects your deploys to Mission Control so agents can run performance audits comparing preview and production builds, catching regressions before they reach users.

[Connect Netlify in Mission Control →](https://continue.dev/integrations/netlify)

## Access and permissions

When connecting Netlify, you provide a personal access token so Continue can query deploys and site configuration. Generate a token from your Netlify user settings — creating one specifically for Continue is recommended.

You can revoke or rotate the token at any time from your Netlify account settings.

## Performance audits

When a pull request is merged, an agent runs Lighthouse audits against both the preview and production deploys and posts a summary to the PR.

For more patterns, see the [Netlify deployment guide](/guides/netlify-mcp-continuous-deployment).
