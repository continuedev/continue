## Overview

Connect Netlify to Continue Mission Control to give your agents access to Netlify's API and CLI. Create projects, deploy applications, configure domains, and manage infrastructure with natural language. When Netlify is enabled, Continue can analyze bundle sizes, audit performance, and prevent performance regressions.

<Card title="What You Can Do with Netlify Integration" icon="bolt">

  - Run Lighthouse audits on PR previews and production
  - Compare bundle sizes and analyze performance regressions
  - Automatically detect configuration issues (minification, caching, tree-shaking)
  - Block PRs that introduce critical performance problems
  - Generate detailed performance reports with actionable fixes
  - Create projects and manage domains with natural language
  - Configure build settings and environment variables

</Card>

## Setup

<Steps>

  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">

    Go to your [Integrations Settings](https://hub.continue.dev/integrations).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Netlify">

    Click "Connect" next to Netlify. You'll need:

    - **Personal Access Token**: Generate from Netlify account settings

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Netlify Access Token">

    To create a personal access token:
    1. Log into your [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com)
    2. Go to **User Settings** → **Applications** → **Personal access tokens**
    3. Click "New access token"
    4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Continue Mission Control")
    5. Copy the token immediately

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Token to Mission Control">

    Paste your access token into the integration form and click "Create Connection"

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>

  **Token Scope**: Personal access tokens have full access to your Netlify account. Create a token specifically for Continue to maintain security and easy revocation if needed.

</Tip>

## Workflows

### Optimize Website Performance

**Trigger**: On PR merge  
**Description**: Run Lighthouse audits on PR preview and production to compare performance

When a pull request is merged, this performance-focused workflow automatically:

1. **Retrieves Deployment Information** - Uses Netlify MCP to get:
   - Production deploy URL and metadata
   - Deploy preview URL for the PR branch
   - Build artifacts and configuration

2. **Analyzes Bundle Sizes** - Compares JavaScript and CSS bundles:
   - Downloads and measures all asset files
   - Calculates total bundle size for both deploys
   - Identifies largest individual files
   - Detects unminified or bloated assets

3. **Reviews Build Configuration** - Examines:
   - `vite.config.ts` or `webpack.config.js` for minification settings
   - `netlify.toml` for cache headers and build commands
   - `package.json` for redundant or oversized dependencies

4. **Identifies Performance Issues** - Classifies problems by severity:
   - 🔴 **Critical**: Minification disabled, bundle size >50% increase, no caching
   - ⚠️ **Warning**: No code splitting, large chunks >500KB, 20-50% bundle increase
   - ℹ️ **Info**: Suboptimal configurations, bundle size less than 20% increase

5. **Generates Actionable Report** - Posts to PR with:
   - Bundle size comparison table
   - Root cause analysis with file references and line numbers
   - Code fixes that can be copy-pasted
   - Merge recommendation (Approved/Review Needed/Blocked)
   - Expected improvements from each fix

<Card title="Why This Matters" icon="gauge-high">

  Performance regressions often slip through code review because:
  - Bundle size increases aren't visible in diffs
  - Configuration errors (disabled minification) go unnoticed
  - Redundant dependencies accumulate over time
  
  This workflow catches these issues automatically before they reach production.

</Card>

<Info>

  **Smart Analysis**: The agent doesn't just report bundle sizes—it analyzes build configurations, identifies root causes, and provides specific code fixes with line numbers.

#### Example Performance Report

After analyzing a deploy preview, the agent posts a comprehensive PR comment like this:

```markdown
## 📊 Netlify Performance Analysis

### Deploy Information
- **Production**: https://site.netlify.app
  - Deployed: 2h ago
  - Commit: abc1234
- **Preview**: https://deploy-preview-123--site.netlify.app
  - Deployed: 5m ago
  - Branch: feature-branch-name
  - Commit: def5678

### 📦 Bundle Size Analysis

| Asset Type | Production | Preview | Change | Status |
|------------|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| JavaScript | 245 KB | 671 KB | +426 KB (+174%) | 🔴 Critical |
| CSS | 12 KB | 12 KB | 0 KB | ✅ |
| Images | 180 KB | 180 KB | 0 KB | ✅ |
| **Total** | **437 KB** | **863 KB** | **+426 KB (+97%)** | 🔴 Critical |

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**🔴 Critical Issue 1: Minification Disabled**
- **File**: `frontend/vite.config.ts:20`
- **Problem**: Build has `minify: false`
- **Impact**: 671 KB unminified JavaScript (should be ~200 KB minified)
- **Fix**:
  \```typescript
  // frontend/vite.config.ts
  build: {
    minify: 'terser',  // Enable minification
  }
  \```
- **Expected improvement**: -70% bundle size

**🔴 Critical Issue 2: Redundant Dependencies**
- **Files**: `frontend/package.json:22-29`
- **Problem**: Multiple date libraries bundled
  - lodash: 528 KB
  - moment: 232 KB
  - date-fns: 76 KB
  - dayjs: 7 KB
- **Fix**: Remove redundant libraries:
  \```bash
  npm uninstall lodash moment date-fns
  \```
- **Expected improvement**: -800 KB bundle

### 🎯 Verdict: 🔴 BLOCK - Critical Performance Regression

**Summary**: This PR introduces severe performance issues:
- Bundle size increased by 426 KB (+174%)
- No minification enabled
- Multiple redundant dependencies

**Recommendation**: Do not merge until critical issues are resolved.

### ✅ Action Plan

**Must fix before merge:**
1. Enable minification in vite.config.ts
2. Remove lodash, moment, date-fns (keep only dayjs)
3. Enable tree-shaking
4. Configure proper Cache-Control headers

**Expected results after fixes:**
- Bundle: ~250 KB (+5 KB from production, acceptable)
- All assets properly cached
- Fast initial and repeat visits
```

### Performance Issue Classification

The agent categorizes issues by severity:

<Accordion title="🔴 Critical - Block Merge">

  **Issues that must be fixed before merging:**
  - Minification disabled (`minify: false`)
  - Tree-shaking disabled (`treeshake: false`)
  - No caching headers (`Cache-Control: no-cache`)
  - Production source maps enabled
  - Bundle size increase >50%
  - Redundant dependencies (lodash + underscore, moment + date-fns + dayjs)

  **Action**: Agent recommends blocking the merge

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="⚠️ Warning - Review Required">

  **Issues that need attention:**
  - No code splitting (single large bundle)
  - Suboptimal cache headers (max-age too low)
  - Large individual chunks (>500KB)
  - Unoptimized images
  - Bundle size increase 20-50%

  **Action**: Agent recommends careful review before merging

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ℹ️ Info - Optimization Opportunities">

  **Non-blocking improvements:**
  - Could use better code splitting
  - Modern browser features could replace polyfills
  - CSS not extracted/split
  - Bundle size increase <20%

  **Action**: Agent approves merge but suggests optimizations

</Accordion>

## Running Netlify Agents in Mission Control

You can run Netlify-connected agents in two ways:

### 1. Manual Tasks

Trigger agents on-demand for deployment operations:

1. Go to [Mission Control Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=agents)
2. Select or create a Netlify-enabled agent
3. Click "Run Agent" and provide your task description
4. Monitor progress and review results in real-time

**Example Tasks:**
- "Create a new deploy preview for the feature/redesign branch"
- "List all sites and their current deployment status"
- "Update production environment variables for API endpoints"

### 2. Automated Workflows

Set up agents to run automatically:

- **PR-triggered**: Audit performance when pull requests are merged
- **Scheduled**: Run weekly bundle size audits across all sites
- **Manual**: Analyze specific deploys or troubleshoot performance issues

<Tip>

  Start with manual performance audits on specific PRs to refine your thresholds, then enable automated workflows to catch all performance regressions.

</Tip>
