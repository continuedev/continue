## What You Can Do in Mission Control

Mission Control is where developers and teams use Continue to power everyday coding workflows. From quick one-off Tasks to fully automated pipelines, everything starts here.

## Components Behind Mission Control

Mission Control uses your configured components to power Agents, Tasks, and Workflows:
Agents are built from reusable components that you can create, share, and customize:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Models" icon="cube">

    Large Language Models from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) configured for specific roles like chat, autocomplete, or editing

  </Card>

  <Card title="MCPs" icon="wrench">

    Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities like database access, web search, or custom functions

  </Card>

  <Card title="Rules" icon="shield">

    Guidelines that shape AI behavior - coding standards, constraints, or specific instructions for your domain

  </Card>

  <Card title="Prompts" icon="message-square">

    Reusable instructions for common tasks, optimized for specific workflows or coding patterns

  </Card>

</CardGroup>

<Tip>

  Components are the building blocks for agents that you can create new or remix from an existing component. When you create a component in mission control, it becomes available according to the permissions you set: Personal, Public, or Organization.

</Tip>


<Accordion title="Component Inputs">

Some components can receive values, including secrets, as inputs through templating. For values that the user needs to set, you can use template variables (e.g. `${{ inputs.API_KEY}}`). Then, the user can set `API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}` in the `with` clause of their agent or config.

<Info>
**Choosing between `secrets.` and `inputs.`**

When creating blocks for the hub:
- Use `${{ inputs.INPUT_NAME }}` in your block definition when you want users to be able to customize which secret is used
- Users will then map their own secrets using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the `with` clause

For personal or single-use configurations, you can skip the inputs layer and reference `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` directly in your block.
