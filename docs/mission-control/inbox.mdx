description: "Your mission control for pull requests — review, merge, and ship code faster with AI-powered assistance"
---

The Inbox is your unified command center for managing pull requests across all your GitHub repositories. Instead of context-switching between GitHub tabs, IDE windows, and chat interfaces, the Inbox brings everything together so you can review code, trigger AI agents, and merge PRs — all from one place.

## Why Use the Inbox?

Modern development teams face a paradox: AI can write code faster than ever, but the review and merge process remains a bottleneck. The Inbox solves this by making PR management as fast as code generation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ship as fast as you code">
    When AI agents generate PRs at scale, you need a way to review and merge them efficiently. The Inbox shows all your open PRs with real-time status — failing checks, review comments, merge conflicts — so you can take action immediately without hunting through GitHub notifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One-click agent assistance">
    See a failing CI check? Click "Fix" and an AI agent will analyze the failure and create a follow-up PR with the solution. Got a nitpicky review comment? Click "Address" and let the agent handle it. The Inbox turns every PR blocker into a one-click automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context without context-switching">
    The Inbox prefetches PR details on hover, shows diffs inline, and lets you merge without leaving the page. You maintain your flow state while staying informed about every PR's status.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Inbox Overview

Navigate to the [Inbox](https://continue.dev/inbox) to see all open pull requests across your connected repositories.

### PR List View

The PR list shows your open pull requests with key information at a glance:

- **Status indicators** — Draft, open, or ready to merge
- **Todo badges** — Count of failing checks, unresolved comments, and actionable agent sessions
- **Running agents** — Spinner icon when agents are actively working on the PR
- **Repository and author** — Quick context without opening the PR
- **Relative timestamps** — How long ago the PR was created

<Tip>
  Hover over any PR card to prefetch its details. When you click through, the detail view loads instantly.
</Tip>

### Filtering PRs

Use the filters at the top of the Inbox to focus on what matters:

- **Repository** — Filter by specific repositories
- **Author** — Show PRs by specific team members or just your own
- **Source** — Filter by GitHub PRs or agent-generated suggestions
- **Status** — Focus on PRs with unresolved items (failing checks, comments, conflicts)

## PR Detail View

Click any PR to open the detail view, which shows everything you need to review and merge.

### Merge Status Panel

The merge status panel at the top provides a comprehensive view of merge readiness:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/inbox/merge-status-panel.png" alt="Merge Status Panel showing circular gauge, status summary, and merge button" />
</Frame>

**Circular Gauge** — Visual representation of PR health:
- Green segments = passing checks
- Yellow segments = pending checks  
- Red segments = failing checks
- Purple segments = unresolved review comments

**Status Summary** — Quick text summary like "2 failing checks, 3 unresolved comments"

**Merge Button** — Merge directly from the Inbox with your preferred merge method:
- Squash and merge (default)
- Create a merge commit
- Rebase and merge

<Note>
  If required checks are failing but you have permission to override, an "Override" checkbox appears next to the merge button.
</Note>

### Collapsible Sections

The detail view organizes PR information into expandable sections that auto-expand when they contain actionable items:

#### Agent Checks Section

Shows all AI agent sessions associated with this PR:

- **Active agents** — Sessions currently running with status indicators
- **Suggested workflows** — Pre-configured agents that match this PR but haven't run yet
- **Quick actions** — Start, view, or manage agent sessions directly

Each agent row shows:
- Agent/workflow name
- Current status (running, completed, needs review, error)
- Action buttons (View, Start, Retry)

<Tip>
  Click "Add Agent" to create a new workflow that will automatically run on future PRs matching this repository and trigger type.
</Tip>

#### Checks Section

Lists all CI/CD checks with their status:

**Failing Checks**
- Expanded by default when failures exist
- Each check shows name, duration, and app icon
- "Fix" button triggers an agent to analyze and fix the failure
- "Fix all" button addresses all failing checks in a single agent session

**Passing Checks** — Collapsed by default, expandable to verify

**Pending Checks** — Shows spinner and "in progress" status

**Skipped Checks** — Neutral checks that didn't run

Click any check to view detailed logs in a modal.

#### Review Comments Section

Displays unresolved review comments with full context:

- Code snippet with diff hunk
- Comment author and timestamp
- File path and line numbers
- "Address" button to trigger an agent that resolves the comment
- "Resolve" button to mark as resolved

<Note>
  When an agent successfully addresses a review comment, the comment is automatically resolved after the agent's PR is merged.
</Note>

#### Merge Conflicts Section

When conflicts exist, this section provides:

- Clear indication that conflicts block merging
- "Resolve" button to trigger an agent that resolves conflicts automatically
- The agent will analyze both branches and create a conflict-free merge

### Tabs

The detail view includes additional tabs for deeper exploration:

**Files** — Browse the diff with a file tree sidebar
- Hierarchical folder structure
- Click files to jump to their diff
- Inline review comments shown in context

**Conversation** — Full PR conversation history from GitHub

**Tasks** — All agent sessions linked to this PR with detailed status

## Shipping Workflow

Here's how to use the Inbox to maintain high velocity:

### 1. Triage Your PRs

Open the Inbox and scan the todo badges. Focus on PRs with:
- Failing checks (red badge)
- Unresolved comments (purple badge)  
- Merge conflicts (conflict indicator)

### 2. Fix Issues with Agents

For each blocker, use one-click agent actions:

| Blocker | Action | What Happens |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Failing check | Click "Fix" | Agent analyzes logs, creates fix PR |
| Review comment | Click "Address" | Agent reads comment, implements change |
| All failing checks | Click "Fix all" | Agent fixes everything in one PR |
| Merge conflicts | Click "Resolve" | Agent resolves conflicts automatically |

### 3. Review Agent Output

When agents complete, their PRs appear as new items in your Inbox. Review the generated code, approve, and merge.

### 4. Merge When Ready

When all checks pass and comments are resolved:
1. Select your merge method from the dropdown
2. Click the merge button
3. The PR is merged without leaving the Inbox

<Tip>
  For PRs created by agents, you can often trust the AI's work and merge quickly. The agent has already run tests and addressed any issues.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Configure workflows for common fixes">
    Create reusable workflows for issues that recur across your codebase — linting fixes, test failures, security updates. These appear as suggested agents on matching PRs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the 'Fix all' button strategically">
    When multiple checks fail for related reasons (e.g., a type error causing cascading test failures), "Fix all" often produces a more coherent solution than fixing checks individually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review in batches">
    Check the Inbox 2-3 times per day rather than constantly. This lets agents work in the background while you focus on deep work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trust but verify agent PRs">
    Agent-generated fixes are usually correct, but always glance at the diff before merging. Look for:
    - Unexpected file changes
    - Overly complex solutions
    - Changes outside the intended scope
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Navigate the Inbox efficiently with keyboard shortcuts:
