Models in Continue can be configured to be used for various roles in the extension.

- [`chat`](./chat.mdx): Used for chat conversations in the extension sidebar
- [`autocomplete`](./autocomplete.md): Used for autocomplete code suggestions in the editor
- [`edit`](./edit.mdx): Used to generate code based on edit prompts
- [`apply`](./apply.mdx): Used to decide how to apply edits to a file
- [`embed`](./embeddings.mdx): Used to generate embeddings used for vector search (@Codebase and @Docs context providers)
- [`rerank`](./reranking.mdx): Used to rerank results from vector search

These roles can be specified for a `config.yaml` model block using `roles`. See the [YAML Specification](../../yaml-reference.md#models) for more details.

## Selecting model roles

You can control which of the models in your assistant for a given role will be currently used for that role. Visit the [Settings page](../settings.md) and go to the **Active Models** section.

:::info
Note that `roles` do not exist within `config.json` - they are infered by the top level keys like `embeddingsProvider`
