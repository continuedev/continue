> What I've seen from gpt and copilot is that it's a good junior and sparring partner, but it's no substitute for a senior. It lacks reasoning and analytical capabilities to be a true senior. For example, it can tell you the difference between mediator and nservicebus (dotnet environment), but it cannot explain which one you should use for the project you are working on.

> I've been using it for a LOT of utility classes, regex expressions, and things like that. It's nowhere near replacing my job yet but it's saved me countless hours on some rather trivial but tedious tasks. Most recent today was a function that converts a string to camel case, worked perfectly right out of the gate. Yea I probably could have found the same function on google in 10 min, but I would have had to comb through ads, and useless posts on stack overflow, before I found one I knew would be performant. It's not laziness, the rest of my job is busy enough, I could have spent an hour or two figuring out the logic from scratch but simply put, this is a far more efficient use of my time.

> Yeah, I just use the free version but I'll ask it to do something, it kinda does it, I ask, "Is this part necessary?" It then responds with oh you're right and redoes it but in a way that still has questions, like I wanted it to explain why it did something the way it did and it takes that as I'm saying it's not really needed. Then I ask it to explain the new changes and it reverts things to the way it did them before thinking I spotted an error in how it redid the code. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I still think it's a nice option to springboard learning or get quick explanations of things with examples, but the more I've used it the less I'm convinced it'll be stealing my job anytime soon. What I actually fear more are engineers and/or middle managers who don't know any better trusting everything it suggests who then think this makes engineers less needed or useful.
