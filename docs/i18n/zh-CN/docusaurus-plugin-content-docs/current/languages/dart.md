> The amazing thing about LLMs like ChatGPT is that they develop a kind of "language sense" and "know" how to stick together the right tokens to achieve a certain goal. They don't "understand" Dart - or any other programming language. They just emit tokens that I probably want to see :) Also, we cannot fully comprehend the amount of data that has been processed. Billions and billions of lines of code in dozens if not hundreds of languages.

> Please note that ChatGPT is not sure about anything. It communicates that it knows what it says is true, but it's known to make up facts. Luckily the answer to your question is in the Dart docs. Alternatively StackOverflow has a sensible answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57936263/dart-set-from-vs-set-of

> antastic recommendations. I actually did have ChatGPT help me override toString for a ton of these classes nested within classes in this giant object I'm trying to print so I can mock. Didn't think to tweak the toString method like that. Not sure I understand your quoted getter though with the slashes. I'll play around with it Monday though.
