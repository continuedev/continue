## Anecdotes from developers

> Chat gpt is known to lie and be confident in its incorrectness. Also, try telling it to convert a program from lisp to python that uses advanced features like the condition system.

> How do you think the advent of ChatGPT and Copilot would affect the adoption and popularity of Common Lisp, Clojure and Schemes? On one hand, Large Language Models did not have access to these "niche" languages for training as much as the more popular alternatives like Python and Typescript so the quality of their output would be worse in comparison. On the other hand, the "interactive" aspect of LISP in that you code stuff, test in REPL and code again would not be so unique since the developer can just use the chat system to refine his solution. The other upside that LISPs had over the likes of Rust and C++ is the lack of syntax clutter and cleanness of s-expressions. In this front too, they would hurt from the likes of ChatGPT since the syntactic complexity is handled by the LLM not the developer.

> I'm an engineer working in the construction field, and I'm currently trying to create a Lisp routine for a project I'm working on. I've been trying to use GPT to generate the code, but I'm having some trouble getting it to work properly.  I was wondering if anyone knows of a pre-trained GPT that has been specifically trained on Lisp code. I've been searching online, but I haven't had any luck so far. If anyone knows of a pre-trained GPT with Lisp, or has any tips for training my own GPT on Lisp code, I would really appreciate the help.
