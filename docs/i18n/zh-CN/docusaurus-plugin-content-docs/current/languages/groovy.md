## Anecdotes from developers

> And that it was possible to use the code created by the tool to generate some code that could be used to start your programming. This could save quite a bit of time for developers to use this as a starting point, and you don’t need to have a large experience to start coding in UDFs in Groovy. It is also interesting that it has much knowledge about what is going on in an SAP universe, I would have thought it was more difficult to get data about it.

> Groovy is a great language with a ton of utility, and can scale like crazy! Write code as dynamic as you want, and choose to refactor into a more type-safe manner later. It's totally worth learning and having it in your toolkit. I program in it every day for many projects. All Java (99.9%) is also valid Groovy, so it's almost impossible not to understand and work with any Java code base you may come across once you get familiar with Groovy. ChatGPT and Github Co-pilot also write excellent Groovy code, which can aid you in learning, and just programming with it in general. It's still actively maintained, too! It's not going away an time soon.

> When I was building react-native-colo-loco, I had to write a Gradle script, which is written in Groovy. I know a little Groovy, but not much. So I focused on writing precise, accurate comments, and let Copilot suggest lines of code. I could then lean on my development experience to pick up on patterns and syntax, and go from there.
