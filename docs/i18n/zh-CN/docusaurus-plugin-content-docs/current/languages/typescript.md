> ChatGPT is great for common knowledge, but it just bullshits for more esoteric stuff. Case in point: & {}: This basically "seals" the type, making it impossible to add new properties to it. This is just pure nonsense as near as I can tell. A big red flag is how vague it is. What does "seals the type" mean? For that matter, what does it mean to "add new properties" to a type? I messed around with it a bit in a TypeScript Playground and I can find no behavior that remotely corresponds to this explanation from ChatGPT.

> As someone also somewhat new to typescript but very comfortable with javascript I know what you're going through. Something I've found to be super useful is asking chatGPT questions when something doesn't make sense to me. It usually provides a correct type and allows me to move on with what I'm trying to do instead of banging my head against the wall for 20 minutes.

> I don't think copilot supports typescript more than any other language. It often gives me incorrect suggestions when it comes to typescript. Probably the only reason I might end up dropping it actually. .
