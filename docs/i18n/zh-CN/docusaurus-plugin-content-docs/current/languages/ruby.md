> Note that the failure mode for ChatGPT is that it will gaslight and lie to you. If you don't give it enough context, or the method names are ambiguous, there's a potential for it to make up explanations that sound plausible, but are dangerously incorrect. I'd advise talking to your team about the things that confuse you germane to your codebase, and only using ChatGPT for general Ruby content.

> Not using copilot for the controversy around it stealing source code. Manager gave me a license however to use tabnine at the moment. In...basic scaffolding code it helps me speed up a bit by generating the blocks for example to write specs quickly, providing about 75% of the structure needed to get the spec fleshed out, e.g faster let declarations and do blocks. But for writing actual code I'm fighting it more than its helping me, since it simply doesn't understand what I am trying to write. Documentation is....hit&miss depending on whether it gets the meaning behind the variable names.

> I use Github copilot (which uses openai's codex) and occasionally throw some questions to ChatGPT. Currently I use it for Ruby and Kotlin. I committed to Copilot after trying it for five minutes. Total game changer. Time spent doing grunt work, writing repetitive tests etc, has dropped by 90% and I'm left with a lot more time to implement elegant solutions rather than throwing in quick fixes to meet tight deadlines. Sometimes it almost seems like it can read my mind. You still need to have the experience and expertise to ensure it hasn't missed the point - it doesn't always have the full context of the problems you're working on - but I would wholeheartedly recommend it to any developer as a way to increase productivity.
