> Assembly isn't one language, it's a general term for any human-readable representation of a processor's ISA. There are many assembly languages, and there are even different representations of the same ISA. I'm not sure what your book you're using but there are operand order differences between AT&T and Intel x86 (although your example looks like AT&T). You shouldn't be using ChatGPT for any subject you aren't already familiar with though, or you won't be able to recognize when it's hallucinating, or even when it's simply lacking context. Just use a normal, reputable resource like the book you're following. I recommend checking out this wikibook for free online: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly

> ChatGPT makes a good attempt, but it doesn't actually understand code — ESPECIALLY assembly language, where each instruction exists in a lot of context — and will usually have some kind of bugs in anything it writes.

> Idk why all the chatGPT comments are all downvoted, guys it is inevitable that it is going to be a standard part of our lives now. The sooner students start using it the sooner people will realize its limitations. It is a great learning tool and I use it when learning a new subject.
