> I use ChatGPT for tools and libs where the documentation is horrendous and it’s a coin toss as to whether it confidently talks truth or nonsense. I don’t think it’s a good idea for beginners to be leaning on it as a teaching aid.

> My experience with ChatGPT is that it sucks ass with C++. Anything beyond basic syntax and programming it just gets wrong. My typical interaction is to ask it something specific, then spend the next 3 queries clarifying and then the next few pointing out issues in the code or methodology. I cannot recommend.

> I have github copilot enabled in my ide, so whatever it suggests I can either use it or ignore. I find it helpful in writing docstrings and filling out somewhat repetitive rows (e.g. pattern matching cases). But otherwise it is not that clever. I also use chatgpt in some rare cases when I am curious how would chatgpt solve this or that problem. It is good to write some simple, short functions; but it is not reliable enough to write medium to very complex algorithms.
