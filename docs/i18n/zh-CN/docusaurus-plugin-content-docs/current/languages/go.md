> Personally for me this is the completely wrong approach. Having the ai write it for you and then understand what it wrote is less than optimal. You should use chatgpt to ask questions, not write code if you don’t understand it. Use it as a mentor who can’t be busy to answer your questions. Not as someone who will complete your homework and then maybe you’ll try and understand it afterwards. If a student actually wants to learn a subject, do they get someone to complete their homework? You get what I mean? If your goal is to just complete a project in anyway. Then maybe might work but most likely won’t. You should understand and come up with the logic behind everything you write before letting ai write it for you. Copilot is good for predictable sequences, but most things logic wise it fails as it does not know implementation.

> ChatGPT (mainly the UI) set a bad example, AI has been way more helpful to me for learning Go than going on Google or reading official docs, but not ChatGPT and rather Forefront, which can use GPT 3.5/4 or their own models but regardless they have a Internet Search function that uses the model to simply summarize dozens of actually real pages it found in a way that is easier for me to understand compared to the original, specially since I can keep chain-asking "what is this/what is that", and all from me explaining step-by-step with "janky" English and the full code. It also lists the pages it used so I can just click them and check it myself, (spoiler alert) it doesn't make as many mistakes as people think, even without search it does a great job understanding code, it won't usually solve more than basic problems and just keeps giving you different snippets to try but most of the time I end up fixing the issue because of the answers, even if the code doesn't work, I don't know how else to explain it. Of course my first language isn't English but I also learn almost entirely by example and docs don't usually have snippets for every little thing the code can do, it also sounds a bit advanced to me because it's just a lot of text with (programming/Go) terms that I usually don't use.

> When I ask ChatGPT about it, it suggests model.go, view.go, controller.go etc. but says itself that the MVC concept does not exist in Go. So I'm interested how developer with some more experience than I in desktop apps would struct it.
