> ChatGPT will make some programmers obsolete. Not because it can program better than them, but because one competent programmer that masters ChatGPT will be able to do the job of 2-3 of his colleagues in the same amount of time.

> I've used it for ideas. Ask it for code for something I'm writing just to see what it suggests. But I don't just copy/paste the code into my project. The first rule of using ChatGPT for coding is, you should only be using ChatGPT for coding if you don't actually need to use ChatGPT for coding. Like, it's good for ideas because it's basically trained on Stackoverflow and the docs, and it's impossible to have heard of or remember every package, module, and function. But if you don't understand what it gives you and you just paste it in, you're not learning anything and are leaving yourself open to big problems.

> I had this exact same crisis of faith in Python about a year ago. The thing that really annoyed me was how much more effortful it was to create some of the features typed languages (especially C# with great interface support) had with a weaker guarantee. AI has fundamentally changed that for me. The SOTA LLMs can code best in python, can create type hints, documentation, and basic assertions/tests nearly free, and the localized hints about type give the AI great hints on how to code. If you accept AI as "augmented intelligence" then coding with python can be a very productive experience in 2023.
