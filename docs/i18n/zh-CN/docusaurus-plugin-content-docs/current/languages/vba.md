> It depends on how you use ChatGPT though. I started a VBA project using methods I had used in the past. When that didn’t work, I tried the Google approach, and still couldn’t do what I wanted. Then, I remembered that ChatGPT does code, and decided to give it a shot. Honestly, what it gave me was riddled with errors, but I went through error by error and forced the AI to come up with corrections. I would copy-past the code into the prompt and ask it to identify potential errors and explain how they could be fixed. I got a really intimate understanding of the code, the reasons for the errors, and the strategies for correcting them. Even then, the code was flawed and ultimately failed. But I was able to use some of what I picked up throughout the process to build my own foundation for the code that would eventually work and used the AI to help fill in the blanks. I got a lot out of the experience. It’s very important to ask very specific questions and to make sure that you understand the recommendations that it makes so you don’t get lost in later steps. I used Google to supplement some of the information the AI gave me to improve my understanding. I spent a lot of time with this thing, and I think we both came out of it just a little better at what we do.

> I've tried using it for VBA/Power Query code, but it's spotty at the best of times. It sometimes will reference functions that don't exist, or will ignore the carefully worded instructions you give it. At its current state it's most useful as a glorified google /stackoverflow search. It can also be helpful while debugging or just to throw some suggestions your way. Writing out the basic structure of my module and asking for recommendations/alternatives to certain implementations is fun and has taught me some new tricks. So it's cool, but not really reliable. Don't let it write your code for you or you might risk spending more time fixing it than you would have just writing it. I'd say it's VBA capabilities are better than its grasp on PowerQuery (M) .

> Lol I just made a comment on another similar post where OP said GPT was incredible for Excel 😂 But yeah, GPT is still awful for VBA or long formulas. I tried giving clear instructions for simple tasks that it couldn’t get right. It’s cool, but long way to go
