> AI tools give me the code I need maybe 20% to 40% of the time. Another 30% or so I have to tweak it to make it work. For the remaining percentages what it spits out needs so many changes it's easier to write it myself than expect that I tweaked it without mistakes. Sometimes it feels like CoPilot might slow me down since now I tend to hit a new line and wait 2-3 seconds to see what it suggests.

> I haven't found any in IDE plug-in that's been all that great. I've used copilot in conjunction with chatGPT and find myself using chatGPT way more than copilot. Keep in mind I use LLMs more as an enhanced search engine than a code writer. For code, I find it helpful to get a second opinion on a refactor, handing over error messages, writing one liners for some logic, and handing over a file to act as a second pair of eyes for what I can't see. Outside of code, I use it as a rubber ducky that can talk back when trying to think through some problems. Though tbh, the act of thinking about my problem and structuring it out to a prompt often solves my problem before I even hit send. Actually, now that I think about it. The damn thing has been a God send for writing and debugging terraform.

> Call me old, but I prefer to code things myself. AI is good to give you hints and steer you in the right direction. It can also write a lot of bullshit that looks like legit code. Then, debugging code that you didn't write gets very difficult. Remember that you write code once, but will read it many, many times. Have your boss pay for training.
