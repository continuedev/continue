## Anecdotes from developers

> I've tried Chat GPT as I've seen some Youtube videos where people act in amazement while saying, "wow! This s amazing, I just give ChatGPT a class and it gives me all the unit tests for it within seconds! Total game changer!". Yeah, doesn't work worth a shit, at least not for me. It'd easier to just write the unit tests than refactor what Chat GPT gave me.

> I am under the impression that the update frequency of PHP libraries has gone down since ChatGPT was released. My interpretation is, that many companies and developers are looking deeply into the AI stuff. And that is not in favor of PHP so that the attention is moving away from PHP solutions (at least temporarily). Once the AI dust has settled we will see the real impact AI has on the PHP market. Anything else what might be relevant was already posted by other members here, so I won't go there.

> Might not be the answer you're looking for but it probably wouldn't be hard to write your own PHPCS sniff for it. Edit: Here is ChatGPT going over how you'd write a sniff for it. I haven't tested it so you might need to modify it a little bit to get it working.
