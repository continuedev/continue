> No, as of now LLM is Just another tool in the toolbox. It makes good coders more effective.

> ChatGPT is not a teaching tool. It isn't capable of understanding, so it cannot properly explain what it's doing. Anything it produces is suspect, because it isn't designed to produce working, clean, modern PowerShell code, it's designed to be a chatbot that puts words next to other words weighted by context clues.

> I've had a mixed bag with copilot. Sometimes it has given pure gold that I didn't think about but other times it suggests super lazy things like += arrays instead of creating a non-fixed array and adding to it. OH the hands down biggest thing it has helped with is working with pester testing. Still learning about it but copilot has certainly helped a bunch.
