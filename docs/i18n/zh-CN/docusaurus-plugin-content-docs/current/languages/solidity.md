## Anecdotes from developers

> ChatGPT is awful at smart contract, the data is years out of date, and it tend to override and make functions that are unnecessary. Even worse it overrides safe good functions for unsafe inefficient functions. Speaking of inefficiency it will seriously de-optimize optimized code, even when asked to gas optimize it.

> Despite the mixed results, ChatGPT, aka GPT-3.5, is a step forward in the direction of writing code with an AI assistant. I actually enjoyed doing these little experiments. However, compared to other experiments I did with JavaScript and other languages, a clear takeaway from my efforts is that when it comes to the Web3 space, GPT doesn’t yet have enough accuracy. In fairness, there is far less available Solidity and Web3-related JavaScript code in the wild than there is general-purpose JavaScript code. Plus, the web3 industry is constantly changing, which makes the problems of ChatGPT relying on an old dataset much worse. . On the positive side, generating an ABI from Solidity is something it did well, which shows it can learn from the available snippets the general rules to create something new.
