## Anecdotes from developers

> chatgpt doesn't know that Kotlin can use java libraries, which makes sense since it knows nothing. Chatgpt doesn't know that you target older Android versions with new languages. The reason why there are more java programs for old reasons is just historical and doesn't benefit java in any way. But chatgpt will never understand this since it can't understand anything. Here chatgpt is correct. It's amazing how it can produce a correct answer without having any idea what it's doing.

> If you want solid foundation, don't. ChatGPT is known for inventing things and confidently state it as if that's true, if you don't have knowledge to judge its output, you can't fully trust the answer.

> Not mentioned yet, but I really believe ChatGPT and Copilot (and whatever is coming down the pike) really reduces the “learning a new language” hump for EVERY language, and definitely for Kotlin. Asking it to do idiomatic Kotlin usually produces quite good results, and asking it how to do a Java thing best in Kotlin definitely does well also. So every new Java developer will be adept at Kotlin even faster than before.
