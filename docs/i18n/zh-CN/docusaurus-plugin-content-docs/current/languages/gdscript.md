> Irrational AI hatred aside, none afaik, godot 4 is too new. When trying to figure out some kinks in my code it kept giving me garbage mixed with outdated godot 3 code. Don't bother, it's faster to just do it yourself for now. It's kind of annoying because in my experience for beginner devs, AI can be a huge help in explaining why your code no worky and how to improve it. It allowed me to go much further in my C++ projects that I thought and saved a ton of time spent on research or debugging.

> I was playing with this yesterday and had some difficulty getting it to produce GDScript instead of Python. It insisted the Python code it generated was GDScript haha. Otherwise it made exactly what I wanted, just in the wrong language.

> You can: Fine-tune ChatGPT. If you're willing to pay, I might help setting it up at some point in the near future. Use a different model like Llama-2 (open-source) which has more recent data (which you can also fine-tune), or from companies like Anthropic/Claude etc. Look (and contribute?) to godot-dodo and Godot Copilot. Export the Godot docs to a PDF and use some plugin, I guess? Never tried it. Copy-paste the GDScript reference page, which will likely improve it's zero-shot predictions.
