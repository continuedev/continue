> I've used ChatGPT Plus, basically the paid version using GPT-4, and while it has helped suggest some new ways of querying stuff that I hadn't considered, it also just completely made things up. Even when I asked to clarify, like "are you sure that function actually exists?" it would apologize and then say the exact same wrong thing lol. There's no real bullshit filter for these LLMs.

> I'm a DBA, 15 years. Chatgpt and other AIs are great up to about the skill level of a intern you'd hire as a jr. After that level of task... it takes more time and effort to vet it's output than it saves. I don't think it's a good tool for those learning, as they won't ever develop the skill to spot when and where the AI is wrong. I think there will be a wall of skill that will be impossible to climb for those who use it rather than working through problems on their own first. If you have the discipline to work the problem yourself and only use it if really stuck or to try an alternative, then it can be a nice assistant, like a personal intern that occasionally lies and tries to set you up for failure.

> Mostly to debug, but I change the table names for privacy reasons. Once in a while I'll ask it to write code from my plain English when I'm trying to solve a problem. I'll give it my broken code or some context first.
