It sucks for Clojure but can be great for other languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc. if you know how to prompt it. As other have mentioned, Copilot excels at reducing boilerplate and picking up on patterns. For example, lets say there is a table of data in a markdown document and you want to convert it to a vector of maps. You can copy/paste the markdown table into your buffer as a comment and just start writing the data structure you want it to be, Copilot will figure it out and complete it. Its also useful for generating random utility functions. Recently in JavaScript, I typed `function lerp` (linear interpolation) and it pretty quickly filled it in. I had an array of hex color values that I wanted to be RGB and I wanted to double the number of values by interpolating between them. All I had to do was type that in a comment and wait a second before it gave me a working rough draft of the function. Copilot can actually do a lot of these things for Clojure but when I was trying to use it I found myself consistently having to fix issues with delimiters, typically round braces. Eventually, I just gave up on it. Maybe I'll give it another shot when Copilot-X releases. ChatGPT is much more useful for Clojure than Copilot. It does hallucinate and get some things wrong but overall its awesome for generating documentation, explaining code, translating diffs into PR notes, and exploring ideas.

It's barfing out examples it was trained on with no idea about what they do, whether they work, and if they are current. Transaction objects no longer have a success method. This was deprecated for a long time ago and finally removed in version 9. The error method returns a single value. Minor problem, but still cruft that shouldn't be there. Call json on the response to get the data structure rather than doing this yourself. Even then, using JSON directly, while fine, skips over the Mojo::JSON::decode_json. It's a bit of a pain in the butt, but work hard to use the same parser everywhere in an application since they tend to have slight differences (say, like how they represent null, true, or false). Somewhere along the line, ChatGPT saw this code or something very similar. It then returns it to you with no intelligence about what it is doing or what it should do. It's very likely that the source ChatGPT saw is not only old, but also unsophisticated. You're likely just cargo-culting off StackOverflow with extra steps.

IMO, this is quite irrelevant, because you must understand that whatever output - be it code, poems or whatever - from an AI-assisted service is not perfect. The main point is: it helps. And that's its main selling point today, because that's how StackOverflow also works: sometimes it's perfect, but most of the times it just helps, maybe because you have addressed the wrong audience, didn't word your question/problem correctly or otherwise. With ChatGPT you get an instant reply, and you can ask it to refine its reply. Instantly. Rinse and repeat.

Never run script you don’t understand. That is a hard pill to shallow when learning bash, but thankfully you can ask chatGPT to explain its reasoning. To be sure, open a new conversation and ask for explanation of part of the code there. You can also ask another instance for a general explanation of a new syntax or command, and then cross-check the original code. After seeing what chatGPT knows about an individual command, it doesn’t hurt to quicklycheck the man-page anyway. ChatGPT is prone for using “general” syntax and flags even when some command doesn’t exist. Lastly, commands can change through years and environments. Your man-pages tell you what version you have. It’s a good strategy to ask if any tools already exist for the task or are build in, before asking for a bash script. For example you could script dropping your ssh-key in a remote machines .ssh-dir and then appending it to the trusted-keys file (or in folder) - or you can just use the ssh commands build in add-key option. There are a lot of tools build in to your average linux installation, and your distros repos are full of even more lightweight, trustworthy tools (as long as you stick to the official repos). If you aren’t exactly sure how a script behaves or if the syntax is robust, create your own test environments. You can create virtual (or real) directory structures, quickly fill them with very small files and run the script without touching your actual data. Ask chatGPT for more information (and use above steps to understand what it says). Related to the last point, pay attention to especially these aspects of any script chatGPT spews back: hardcoded paths (or less strictly, any path that isn’t declared as a variable on the start of the script). If instead of a robust test environment, you just use a directory with subdirectories, hardcoded paths can escape that environment,  connections outside your machine/local network: While I feel it is unlikely that chatGPT will compromise your system by opening an unsafe connection to unsafe address, the risk is worth mitigating. What if the first guy who got that address noticed it’s not used, and bought it to distribute malware, hoping chatGPT offers it again? But more likely problem is that you can rapidly pull a lot of data from the internet. It just opens up more doors to make a mess,  modifying files in /etc, or your bootloader. You can cause all kinds of damage, including permanently disabling rights to modify the files to fix it (misconfigured privileges), making your system unbootable (fstab, grub), and just generally messing up your system. Back it up before any changes, read the man-pages twice, make small tests (and remember you usually need to reload systemd or reboot before changes take effect)",u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU,https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/123buum/comment/jduund7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
