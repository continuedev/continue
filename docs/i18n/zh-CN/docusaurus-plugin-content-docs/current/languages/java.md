> Anyone who tried to use ChatGPT to solve some real-world programming issues knows, that even if you are able to replace 1-2 juniors with it, you will lose 1 senior to filter out the nonsense it can produce with full confidence. Not worth it. What's worse - I've seen many beginners treating AI as some form of oracle and believing everything it spits out even if it's all false. But AI is a powerful tool and it's worth checking it out and tracking its progress. Who knows what it will look like in a few years?

> I have to wonder if AI translation is determinate. I use Github Copilot fairly often, and it returns schizophrenic suggestions apparently at random. It also seems stuck in pre Java-8 for syntax (I've never seen it use switch expressions, and it rarely uses streams).

> I've been using GitHub Copilot with Android Studio for a couple of months. It's actually amazing. It doesn't produce a ton of suggestions, but the ones it does produce are right a lot of the time. Even the wrong ones are often pretty close and only need minor editing. It won't write full classes but it can write short methods or blocks of code. Highly recommend.
