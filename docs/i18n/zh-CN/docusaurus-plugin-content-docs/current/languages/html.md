> i actually used chatgpt to some extent but it doesn't help more than giving directions. i could come up with a fairly okay layout with objects and movement with chatgpt but it doesn't do much more than that

> ChatGPT is up to date as of 2021. That means that any information you get from it is already 2 years out of date. For fast moving languages like Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, etc., that's too old. I've been able to make use of it because I have questions about setting up servers and how to refactor old Perl code, but other than that it's just not ready for primetime, yet, IMHO.

> One thing about ChatGPT is that it names its IDs and classes very specifically and rarely uses element-level styles. In my experience, it will give an element a class even if it's the only one on the page. I'm not sure if this practice differs based on the version.
