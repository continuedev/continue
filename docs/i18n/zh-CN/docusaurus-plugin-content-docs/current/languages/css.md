> I'm not sure how it could help learn. I spent a little while messing with it and trying to generate some html/css/js for a simple responsive hamburger menu. Results were mixed. It got me most of the way there, but had trouble really putting it all together into one menu that worked as intended. I could have spent more time trying to manipulate it, but that would've taken more time that it would have to make the thing by hand. On some level it's just google with extra steps since you need to check and verify everything it outputs. I found that Lucas from LTT had a good assessment of it: it's usually pretty good, but when it's wrong, it's confidently wrong. I think it would be a crappy teaching aid since the student doesn't immediately recognize when the bot is wrong or why the code it produced doesn't work.

> I use chatgpt daily and it works wonders, if you know what you're reading. Otherwise, if you don't know something as a complete beginner and take chatgpt response as gospel, you're gonna be in a world of hurt when it starts lying to you giving 3 year old outdated information..

> In that case it's great. And I like ChatGPT too. But a complete beginner doesn't see possible flaws in the solution. So there is the possibility they learn a bad practice. I use ChatGPT too sometimes, but you will need to look at the code. Don't just copy and paste.
