## How to Create an AI Assistant from Scratch

To create an assistant from scratch, select “New assistant” in the top bar.

Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your assistant.

The easiest way to create an assistant is to click "Create assistant" with the default configuration and then add / remove blocks using the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can edit the assistant YAML directly before clicking "Create assistant". Refer to examples of assistants on [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants) and visit the [YAML Reference](/reference#complete-yaml-config-example) docs for more details.

## How to Remix an Assistant

You can also create an assistant by remixing an existing one. This is useful if you want to start with a pre-configured assistant and make modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to

1. add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
2. change the name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create assistant” will make this assistant available for use.
