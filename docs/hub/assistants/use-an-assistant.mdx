## Steps to Use an AI Assistant in Continue

Once you've found the assistant you want to use on Continue Hub:

1. Click “Add Assistant” on its page
2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)
3. Select “Save changes” in assistant sidebar on the right hand side

After saving, open your IDE extension and:

- Select the assistant from the **assistant dropdown** in the Continue extension.
- Begin using it for chat, code generation, or other configured capabilities.
