---

Once you've created a workflow, you can easily edit and update it through the Continue Hub interface. Editing workflows allows you to refine prompts, update tools and rules, and improve functionality based on usage feedback.

## Accessing the Edit Interface

### From the Workflow Page

NEEDS_IMAGE

To edit an existing workflow:

1. Navigate to your workflow's page at `hub.continue.dev/[owner-slug]/[package-slug]`
2. Click the **pencil icon** (edit button) in the workflow header
3. This opens the same form interface used for creating new workflows

<Info>

  You can only edit workflows that you own or have edit permissions for within your organization.

</Info>

### From the Agents Interface

You can also access workflow editing directly from the agents interface:

<Card title="Quick Edit Access" icon="external-link">

  - Select a workflow in the agents interface dropdown
  - Click the external link icon next to the workflow selector
  - This opens the workflow page in a new tab
  - Click the pencil icon to start editing

</Card>

## Edit Form Interface

NEEDS_IMAGE

The workflow edit form is nearly identical to the new workflow creation form, with a few key differences:

### Pre-populated Fields

<Card title="Existing Configuration" icon="database">

  All fields are pre-populated with current workflow values:

  - **Name**: Current workflow name
  - **Description**: Existing description
  - **Prompt**: Current prompt content
  - **Model**: Selected model (if any)
  - **Tools**: Currently configured tools
  - **Rules**: Applied rules
  - **Slug**: Package identifier (read-only when editing)

</Card>

### Form Layout

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Left Sidebar" icon="sidebar">

    **Configuration Panel**:
    - Name and description fields
    - Model selector
    - Tools multi-select
    - Rules multi-select
    - Visibility settings (if permissions allow)

  </Card>

  <Card title="Main Editor" icon="edit">

    **Content Editor**:
    - Markdown/Preview tabs
    - Real-time content synchronization
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Auto-save indicators

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Making Changes

### Updating Basic Information

<Card title="Metadata Changes" icon="info">

  **Name**: Update the display name
  - Changes reflect immediately in workflow selectors
  - Consider impact on team members who use this workflow
  - Clear, descriptive names improve discoverability

  **Description**: Modify the workflow description
  - Helps team members understand the workflow's purpose
  - Displayed in workflow listings and previews
  - Include any usage notes or prerequisites

</Card>

### Modifying the Prompt

<Card title="Prompt Updates" icon="message-square">

  **Refinement Strategies**:
  - Add more specific instructions based on usage feedback
  - Include examples of desired output formats
  - Clarify edge cases or special handling requirements
  - Reference project-specific conventions or standards

  **Testing Approach**:
  - Test prompt changes with the [Continue CLI](../../guides/cli) first
  - Start with small, incremental improvements
  - Validate changes against known successful use cases

</Card>

### Tool and Rule Configuration

<Card title="Configuration Updates" icon="settings">

  **Adding Tools**: 
  - Include new MCP servers as they become available
  - Add specific tools for enhanced functionality
  - Format: `owner/package` or `owner/package:tool-name`

  **Updating Rules**:
  - Add organizational rules as they're created
  - Remove obsolete or conflicting rules
  - Ensure rule references are valid and accessible

  **Model Selection**:
  - Update to newer or more appropriate models
  - Consider performance vs. cost trade-offs
  - Test with different models for optimal results

</Card>

## Version Management

### Creating New Versions

<Card title="Versioning System" icon="git-branch">

  **Automatic Versioning**: Each edit creates a new version
  - Previous versions remain accessible
  - Existing workflow executions continue to work
  - Gradual rollout to minimize disruption

  **Version Benefits**:
  - Rollback capability if issues arise
  - A/B testing between versions
  - Team can adopt updates at their own pace

</Card>

### Update Process

When you save changes:

1. **Validation**: System validates configuration and references
2. **Version Creation**: New version is created with your changes
3. **Deployment**: Updated workflow becomes the default version
4. **Notification**: Team members see the updated workflow in their interface

<Warning>

  Significant prompt changes may affect workflow behavior. Test thoroughly and communicate changes to your team.

</Warning>

## Collaboration and Permissions

### Edit Permissions

<Card title="Who Can Edit" icon="users">

  **Workflow Owner**: Full edit access to all aspects
  
  **Organization Members**: Edit access based on organization settings
  - May have restrictions on visibility changes
  - Tool and rule access based on organization permissions
  
  **Collaborators**: Limited edit access if explicitly granted

</Card>

### Team Considerations

<Card title="Team Impact" icon="team">

  **Communication**: Notify team members of significant changes
  - Update internal documentation
  - Share reasoning for major prompt modifications
  - Provide migration guidance if needed

  **Testing**: Validate changes don't break existing use cases
  - Test with representative repositories
  - Verify tool integrations still work
  - Confirm rule applications are correct

</Card>

## Best Practices for Editing

### Incremental Improvements

<Card title="Iterative Approach" icon="refresh">

  **Small Changes**: Make incremental improvements rather than major overhauls
  - Easier to identify what works and what doesn't
  - Reduces risk of breaking existing functionality
  - Allows for gradual learning and optimization

  **Document Changes**: Keep track of what you modify and why
  - Helps with troubleshooting if issues arise
  - Provides context for future improvements
  - Useful for team knowledge sharing

</Card>

### Testing Strategy

<Card title="Validation Process" icon="check-circle">

  **Pre-deployment Testing**:
  - Test with Continue CLI in "TUI mode" first
  - Use test repositories that mirror production scenarios
  - Validate against known successful workflows

  **Post-deployment Monitoring**:
  - Monitor workflow execution success rates
  - Gather feedback from team members
  - Track performance and adjust as needed

</Card>

### Content Management

<Card title="Content Strategy" icon="file-text">

  **Markdown/Form Sync**: Changes sync between the form interface and markdown editor
  - Use the form for structured configuration
  - Use markdown editor for complex prompt formatting
  - Preview tab shows final rendered content

  **Backup Considerations**: Previous versions serve as backups
  - No need to manually backup workflow content
  - Can reference previous versions for rollback
  - Version history maintains change tracking

</Card>

## Common Edit Scenarios

    # After  
    tools: "built_in, continuedev/filesystem, neworg/database-tools"
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule Updates">

    1. Use Express.js with TypeScript
    2. Include input validation with Joi
    3. Add comprehensive error handling
    4. Include OpenAPI documentation
    5. Follow the existing authentication patterns
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Edit Issues

### Common Problems

<Card title="Edit Issues and Solutions" icon="alert-triangle">

  **Permission Denied**: Verify you have edit access to the workflow
  - Check with workflow owner for permissions
  - Ensure you're logged into the correct account
  - Verify organization membership if applicable

  **Configuration Errors**: Use the preview tab to identify issues
  - Check YAML syntax in frontmatter
  - Validate tool and rule references
  - Ensure required fields are not empty

  **Sync Problems**: If form and markdown get out of sync
  - Refresh the page to reload current state
  - Use one editing method at a time (form OR markdown)
  - Save frequently to prevent data loss

</Card>
