---

Continue Hub allows you to create custom workflow configurations that can be reused across different repositories and shared with your team.

## Workflow Creation Interface

NEEDS_IMAGE

Access the workflow creation interface by:

1. Navigate to the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev)
2. Click "New Agent" or use the "+ New Workflow" button
3. Choose "Workflow" as the agent type

## Workflow Configuration

### Basic Information

<Card title="Workflow Metadata" icon="info">

  **Name**: Display name for your workflow (required)
  - Used in the workflow selector dropdown
  - Should be descriptive and concise
  - Example: "Create Custom Ticket", "Fix TypeScript Errors"

  **Description**: Brief explanation of what the workflow does
  - Helps team members understand the workflow's purpose
  - Displayed in workflow listings and previews

  **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated)
  - Automatically created from the workflow name
  - Can be customized if needed
  - Must be unique within your organization/account

</Card>

### Core Configuration

<Card title="Essential Settings" icon="settings">

  **Prompt** (Required): The main instructions for the AI agent
  - This is the core logic of your workflow
  - Can include variable placeholders
  - Should be specific and actionable
  - Example: "Given the following user request, create a GitHub issue with proper labels and assignees"

  **Model**: Specific AI model to use
  - Optional - defaults to organization/account settings
  - Can specify different models for different workflows
  - Choose based on task complexity and requirements

</Card>

### Advanced Configuration

#### Tools Integration

<Card title="Tool Selection" icon="wrench">

  Configure which tools your workflow can access:

  **Built-in Tools**:
  - File system operations
  - Git commands
  - Code analysis tools
  - Web search capabilities

  **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers for extended functionality
  - Format: `owner/package-name` for all tools from a server
  - Format: `owner/package-name:tool-name` for specific tools
  - Examples: `continuedev/filesystem`, `anthropic/mcp-server-git:commit`

  **Tool String Format**:
  ```yaml
  tools: "built_in, owner/mcp-server, owner/server:specific-tool"
  ```

</Card>

#### Rules and Context

<Card title="Rule Configuration" icon="book">

  **Rules**: Predefined context and constraints
  - Coding standards and style guides
  - Organization-specific policies
  - Security and compliance requirements
  - Format: `owner/rule-name` (e.g., `myorg/typescript-standards`)

  **Rule Benefits**:
  - Consistent output across workflows
  - Reduced prompt engineering
  - Organizational best practices enforcement

</Card>

### Workflow File Structure

Workflows are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Create Custom Ticket
description: Create a GitHub issue based on user requirements
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
tools: built_in, continuedev/github
rules: myorg/ticket-standards, myorg/security-review
---

Given the following user request, create a detailed GitHub issue following these guidelines:

1. **Title**: Create a clear, concise title
2. **Description**: Include comprehensive details
3. **Labels**: Apply appropriate labels based on content
4. **Assignees**: Suggest relevant team members
5. **Priority**: Assess and set priority level

Always follow the organization's ticket creation standards and ensure all security considerations are addressed.
```

## Creation Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

<Card title="Workflow Creation Steps" icon="list">

  1. **Start with the Sidebar**: Configure basic metadata and settings
  2. **Write the Prompt**: Develop clear, actionable instructions
  3. **Select Tools**: Choose appropriate tools for the task
  4. **Add Rules**: Include relevant organizational rules
  5. **Configure Model**: Select optimal AI model if needed

  7. **Test**: Run the workflow on a test repository
  8. **Publish**: Save and make available to your team

</Card>

### Form Interface

NEEDS_IMAGE

The workflow creation form provides:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Left Sidebar" icon="sidebar">

    **Configuration Panel**:
    - Name and description fields
    - Model selector with organization models
    - Tools multi-select with MCP integration
    - Rules multi-select with validation
    - Visibility and permissions settings

  </Card>

  <Card title="Main Editor" icon="edit">

    **Content Editor**:
    - Tabbed interface (Markdown/Preview)
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Real-time preview
    - Auto-sync between form fields and markdown

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Validation and Testing

<Card title="Quality Assurance" icon="check">

  **Automatic Validation**:
  - YAML frontmatter syntax checking
  - Required field validation
  - Tool reference validation
  - Rule slug format verification

  **Testing Recommendations**:
  - Test with the [Continue CLI](../../guides/cli) first
  - Start with simple, known-working scenarios
  - Validate on multiple repository types
  - Get team feedback before wide deployment

</Card>

## Sharing and Collaboration

### Visibility Options

<Card title="Access Control" icon="eye">

  **Public**: Available to all Continue Hub users
  - Discoverable in community workflows
  - Can be forked and modified by others
  - Good for open-source contributions

  **Organization**: Limited to organization members
  - Shared across team members
  - Maintains organizational standards
  - Can include proprietary logic

  **Private**: Only accessible to you
  - Personal workflows and experiments
  - Can be promoted to organization later

</Card>

### Version Management

<Info>

  Workflows support versioning - updates create new versions while maintaining backward compatibility for existing automations.

</Info>

## Best Practices

### Prompt Design

<Card title="Effective Prompting" icon="message-square">

  **Be Specific**: Include exact requirements and constraints
  - Bad: "Fix the bugs"
  - Good: "Fix TypeScript compilation errors in the src/ directory, ensuring all type annotations are correct"

  **Include Context**: Provide necessary background information
  - Project structure expectations
  - Coding standards to follow
  - Integration requirements

  **Define Success**: Clearly state what constitutes completion
  - Expected outputs
  - Quality criteria
  - Testing requirements

</Card>

### Tool Selection

<Card title="Tool Strategy" icon="wrench">

  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only include necessary tools
  - Reduces potential for unintended actions
  - Improves security posture
  - Simplifies troubleshooting

  **Layer Tools Appropriately**: 
  - Start with built-in tools
  - Add specific MCP tools as needed
  - Consider tool interactions and dependencies

</Card>

### Organizational Guidelines

<Card title="Team Workflows" icon="users">

  **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming patterns
  - Use descriptive, action-oriented names
  - Include context about the workflow's purpose
  - Follow team/organization naming standards

  **Documentation**: Include comprehensive descriptions
  - Document expected inputs and outputs
  - Explain any prerequisites or setup requirements
  - Provide usage examples

  **Testing Protocol**: Establish testing procedures
  - Test on representative repositories
  - Validate with different team members
  - Monitor performance and adjust as needed

</Card>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="YAML Parsing Errors">

    **Symptoms**: Configuration fails to save or load

    **Solutions**:
    - Check YAML syntax in the preview tab
    - Ensure proper indentation and structure
    - Validate special characters are properly escaped
    - Use the form interface to avoid syntax errors

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Reference Errors">

    **Symptoms**: Tools not available during workflow execution

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify MCP server slug format (`owner/package`)
    - Check tool name spelling and availability
    - Ensure proper permissions for MCP servers
    - Test with built-in tools first

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rule Validation Failures">

    **Symptoms**: Rule references marked as invalid

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify rule exists and is accessible
    - Check slug format (`owner/rule-name`)
    - Ensure proper permissions to referenced rules
    - Contact rule owner if access needed

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Migration and Updates

### Updating Existing Workflows

<Card title="Version Management" icon="git">

  **Creating Updates**:
