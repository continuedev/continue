description: "Run Continuous AI workflows in the background using the Continue Hub agents interface with GitHub integration and customizable prompts"
---

<Info>

  Workflows are in beta. Please share any feedback with us in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions/8051).

</Info>

Workflows are a way to run and manage background agents in Continue. You can use them for:
- Addressing small nitpicks and bugs
- Building boilerplate-heavy features
- Investigating an issue to kickstart your work
- [Automated security scanning](../../guides/snyk-mcp-continue-cookbook)
- Running repeatable tasks with your own rules, prompts, and MCP servers
- Much more!

## Getting Started

To run your first workflow:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents)
![Workflows Github and Model setup](/images/hub/workflows/images/workflows-onboarding.png)
2. **Connect with your GitHub account** - This is required to enable repository access and branch selection
3. **Set up a model** - You can either provide an Anthropic API key, or follow the instructions to add a different model
![Workflows Interface](/images/hub/workflows/images/workflows-setup.png)
4. **Select a repository** - Choose which codebase the workflow should operate on
5. **Choose a branch** - Pick the specific branch for the workflow to work with
6. **Enter your prompt** - Describe the task you want the AI agent to accomplish
7. **Click the send button** or press enter to kick off your workflow

## Example Workflow Tasks

Here are some example tasks you can try with your workflows:

## Best Practices for Continuous AI

The practice of using background agents, which we call Continuous AI, requires practice and forethought to set up the right guiderails and habits to fit your development workflow, much like learning to work with a larger engineering team. We are constantly sharing our learnings on the [Continuous AI Blog](https://blog.continue.dev).

<Card title="Getting Started Successfully" icon="rocket">

  **Start Local**: Practice running workflows locally using the [Continue CLI](../../guides/cli) `--workflow` flag in "TUI mode". The Continue CLI is used to run workflows in the hub, so you can also test your workflow agents and prompts locally.

  **Begin Small**: Identify and begin with tasks that you are confident can be accomplished by Continue, e.g., a small bug with a simple and isolated fix.

  **Iterate and Improve**: Once you have merged a PR created by Continue, try larger tasks. By being willing to start tasks that might not succeed on the first try; you will learn about prompting best practices and limitations of current language models.

<Card title="Effective Prompting" icon="message-circle">

  **Be Thorough**: Workflows can run for a long time to complete their task, so it is worthwhile to invest in sharing all of the important details.

  **Provide Context**: Include information about:
  - Project structure and conventions
  - Expected coding standards
  - Integration requirements
  - Success criteria

  **Use Examples**: When possible, reference existing code patterns or provide examples of desired output.

</Card>

<Card title="Team Integration" icon="users">

  **Communicate with Your Team**: Truly embracing Continuous AI likely means acknowledging that a higher volume of PRs will be created and adjusting your code review habits.

  **Establish Guidelines**: Work with your team to establish:
  - When to use workflows vs manual development
  - Code review standards for AI-generated code
  - Testing requirements for workflow outputs
  - Rollback procedures if issues arise

  **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly assess workflow effectiveness and adjust prompts, tools, and processes based on team feedback.
