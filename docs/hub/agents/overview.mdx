<Card title="🧠 Agents in Continue" icon="robot">
  Agents are custom AI workflows that combine a prompt, rules, and tools (MCPs) to complete specific, repeatable tasks.
  They live in the Continue Hub and can be executed from Mission Control (web interface), TUI mode, or headless automation.
</Card>

## What Are Agents?

Agents let your team standardize common workflows — like opening GitHub PRs, summarizing analytics, or auditing security. Each agent includes:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Prompt** | The agent's primary instruction | "Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue." |
| **Rules** | Standardized system behaviors | "Always summarize user context before opening PR." |
| **Tools / MCPs** | Connected integrations | GitHub, PostHog, Supabase |
| **Model** | The LLM used | Claude Sonnet 3.5 |
| **Visibility** | Access scope | Public / Organization / Private |

<Info>
  Mission Control is in beta. Please share any feedback with us in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions/8051).

## Ways to Run Agents

You can run Agents in three main ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🌐 Mission Control">
    **Interactive web interface**
    
    Trigger from the Continue Hub and review results in real-time.
    
    ```bash
    # Navigate to hub.continue.dev/agents
    # Click "Run Agent" on any agent
    # Monitor progress and review outputs
    ```
    
    Perfect for: Interactive debugging, reviewing agent outputs, team collaboration
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="💻 TUI Mode">
    **Interactive terminal mode**
    
    Launch from terminal for live interaction and testing.
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent my-org/github-pr-agent
    # Interactive chat interface opens
    # Type your specific request
    # Review and approve actions
    ```
    
    Perfect for: Local development, testing prompts, quick one-off tasks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🤖 Headless Mode">
    **Automated execution**
    
    Run one-off or scheduled tasks automatically without interaction.
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent my-org/snyk-agent "Run weekly security scan" --auto
    ```
    
    Perfect for: CI/CD pipelines, scheduled tasks, webhook integrations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pre-configured Agents

Skip the setup and use battle-tested agents from our cookbook collection:

  **Explore More Agents**: Browse the complete collection of pre-configured agents and MCP integration cookbooks in our [Guides Overview](/guides/overview#mcp-integration-cookbooks).

## Webhook Integrations

Trigger Agents automatically through secure webhooks for CI/CD integration:

```bash
POST /webhooks/ingest/:webhookId
{
  "payload": { "trigger": "nightly-security-scan" }
}
```

Perfect for connecting with:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Monitoring alerts (Sentry, DataDog)
- Deployment pipelines
- Scheduled maintenance tasks

## Team Collaboration

Agents are organizational assets — once created, everyone in your org can use them:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Create, edit, and delete Agents |
| **Member** | Run Agents and view results |
| **Viewer** | View and monitor Agent sessions |

Each update is versioned, so your team can track changes to prompts, rules, and configurations.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Try a Pre-configured Agent">
    Start with a cookbook agent like `continuedev/github-project-manager-agent`:
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent continuedev/github-project-manager-agent "List open issues labeled bug"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Practice with TUI Mode">
    Test agents locally before automation:
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent
    # Interactive mode - perfect for learning
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    Ready to build custom workflows? Learn how in our [Create and Edit guide](/hub/agents/create-and-edit).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Automation">
    Integrate with CI/CD using headless mode and webhooks for continuous workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

The practice of using background agents, which we call Continuous AI, requires forethought to set up the right guardrails:

- **Start Small**: Begin with tasks you're confident Continue can accomplish
- **Use Thorough Prompts**: Agents can run for extended periods, so invest in detailed instructions  
- **Test Locally First**: Practice with TUI mode before deploying to production
- **Team Alignment**: Discuss agent usage and adjust code review habits for higher PR volume
- **Iterate and Improve**: Be willing to refine prompts based on results
