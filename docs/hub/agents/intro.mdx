<Card title="🚀 Quick Start with Mission Control" icon="rocket">
  Mission Control is your web interface for running and managing AI agents. Get started in minutes with pre-built workflows for security scanning, GitHub management, analytics insights, and more.
</Card>

<Info>
  Mission Control is in beta. Please share any feedback with us in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions/8051).
</Info>

Use Mission Control to kick off agents for:
- **Bug fixes & code quality** - Address nitpicks and technical debt
- **Feature development** - Build boilerplate-heavy features  
- **Security & compliance** - [Automated vulnerability scanning](../../guides/snyk-mcp-continue-cookbook)
- **Investigation & analysis** - Research issues to kickstart your work
- **Custom workflows** - Run repeatable tasks with your own rules and prompts

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Mission Control">
    Go to [hub.continue.dev/agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents) and connect with your GitHub account.
    
    ![Mission Control Setup](/images/hub/workflows/images/workflows-setup.png)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose an Agent">
    Select from pre-configured agents or create your own:
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Security Scanner" icon="shield-check">
        `continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent`
        Finds vulnerabilities and creates fix PRs
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="GitHub Manager" icon="github">
        `continuedev/github-project-manager-agent`  
        Triages issues and manages workflows
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your First Agent">
    Enter a prompt and watch your agent work:
    
    ```
    "Fix the TypeError in api/users.ts and open a PR with tests"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Success

The practice of using agents (Continuous AI) requires thoughtful setup of guardrails and habits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Small" icon="seedling">
    Begin with tasks you're confident Continue can handle, like fixing known bugs with simple solutions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Practice Locally" icon="terminal">
    Test with [Continue CLI](../../guides/cli) in TUI mode before deploying automation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Be Thorough" icon="clipboard-list">
    Agents can run for extended periods - invest time in detailed prompts with all important context.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Team Alignment" icon="users">
    Discuss agent usage and adjust code review habits for higher PR volumes.
