<Info>
  The Slack integration allows you to start and manage Continue agents directly from your Slack workspace. This is currently in beta.
</Info>

## Overview

The Continue Slack integration enables you to:

- **Start agents** by mentioning `@Continue` in any Slack channel
- **Send follow-up messages** to existing agents by mentioning `@Continue` in the agent's thread
- **Select repositories** interactively when starting an agent
- **Configure default repositories** to streamline agent creation
- **Use agent files** to customize behavior with specific prompts, tools, and rules

## Setup

### 1. Install the Slack App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Slack">
    Click the "Connect" button next to Slack and authorize the app in your workspace
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete OAuth">
    After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Continue Hub with a success message
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Connect GitHub

Before using the Slack integration, ensure you have the Continue GitHub App installed:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Click "Connect" next to GitHub
3. Grant access to the repositories you want Continue to work with

## Usage

### Starting an Agent

There are three ways to start an agent from Slack:

#### 1. With a Prompt and Inline Repository

Mention `@Continue` with your prompt and specify a repository:

```
@Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug
```

The repository name should match one of your GitHub repositories that the Continue GitHub App has access to.

#### 2. With a Prompt (Uses Default Repo)

If you've configured a default repository, simply mention `@Continue` with your prompt:

```
@Continue Add unit tests for the authentication service
```

Continue will use your default repository automatically.

#### 3. Without a Prompt (Interactive Selection)

Mention `@Continue` without any prompt to get an interactive repository picker:

```
@Continue
```

Continue will show a dropdown menu of your accessible repositories. Select one to create an agent.

### Sending Follow-up Messages

Once an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the agent's thread:

```
@Continue Also add error handling for edge cases
```

Continue will add your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one.

### Restarting Shut Down Agents

If an agent's devbox has been shut down (due to inactivity or other reasons), Continue will automatically create a replacement agent when you try to send a message:

```
@Continue Continue working on this
```

You'll see a message like "The agent is back online! ü§ñ" with a link to the new agent session.

## Configuration

### Setting a Default Repository

Configure a default repository to streamline agent creation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    Navigate to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find Your Slack Integration">
    Locate your connected Slack workspace in the integrations list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Default Repo">
    Click "Edit" and enter the full GitHub URL of your default repository (e.g., `https://github.com/myorg/myapp`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Custom Agent Files

You can configure a default agent file that will be used for all Slack-triggered agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Agent File">
    Go to [hub.continue.dev/new?type=agentFile](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=agentFile) and create your custom agent configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Slack Integration">
    In your Slack integration settings, select your agent file from the dropdown
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your agent file can include:
- Custom prompts and instructions
- Specific tools and MCP servers
- Rules for code quality and style
- Model selection

## Organization-Level Integrations

Organization admins can set up Slack integrations at the organization level:

1. Navigate to your organization settings: `hub.continue.dev/organizations/{org-slug}/settings/integrations`
2. Connect Slack for the organization
3. Configure default settings that apply to all organization members

Organization-level integrations:
- Share the same default repository across the team
- Use organization-scoped agent files
- Access organization GitHub repositories
- Provide consistent agent behavior across the team

## Help Command

Get help and see available commands by mentioning:

```
@Continue /help
```

This will show you usage examples and available options.

## Thread Context

Continue automatically captures the context of your Slack thread when creating an agent. This includes:

- Previous messages in the thread
- Any code snippets shared
- Links and attachments
- The full conversation history

This context is passed to the agent, allowing it to understand the full scope of your request.

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific in Your Prompts

Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:

‚úÖ **Good**: `@Continue repo=api-server Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`

‚ùå **Poor**: `@Continue fix auth`

### 2. Use Thread Context

Start a conversation in a thread to provide context before requesting work:

```
User: I'm seeing errors in the login flow when users have special characters in their passwords
User: @Continue Investigate and fix this issue
```

### 3. Configure Default Repositories

For projects you work on frequently, set a default repository to avoid specifying `repo=` every time.

### 4. Use Agent Files for Consistency

Create agent files with custom rules and prompts for recurring types of work. For example:
- A "code review" agent file with specific review guidelines
- A "documentation" agent file that follows your doc style guide
- A "bug fix" agent file with debugging tools and error handling patterns

### 5. Monitor Agent Progress

Click the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in Mission Control:

```
ü§ñ Agent created (view agent)
```

You can see:
- Current status (Planning, Working, Done)
- Files being modified
- Pull request details
- Any errors or blockers

## Troubleshooting

### "No accessible repositories found"

**Problem**: You see this error when trying to start an agent.

**Solution**: Install the Continue GitHub App and grant it access to your repositories:
1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Connect GitHub and authorize repository access

### "User not found"

**Problem**: Continue can't match your Slack user to a Continue Hub account.

**Solution**: Ensure your Slack email matches your Continue Hub account email. If you're using a different email:
1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/profile](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/profile)
2. Update your email to match your Slack email
3. Or update your Slack email to match your Continue email

### Repository Not Found

**Problem**: When using `repo=my-repo`, Continue says the repository wasn't found.

**Solution**: 
- Verify the repository name exactly matches your GitHub repository name (case-sensitive)
- Ensure the Continue GitHub App has access to that specific repository
- Try using the interactive repository picker instead: just mention `@Continue` without specifying a repo

### Agent Link Returns "Not Found"

**Problem**: Clicking the agent link shows "Agent Not Available".

**Solution**: 
- The agent's devbox may have been shut down. Try mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread to create a replacement agent
- Check Mission Control at [hub.continue.dev/agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents) to see all your agent sessions

### Messages Not Being Delivered

**Problem**: Continue isn't responding to your mentions.

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're mentioning `@Continue` (not just typing "Continue")
2. Check that the Slack integration is still connected in your settings
3. Ensure you're in a channel where the Continue app has been invited
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the Slack integration

## Security & Privacy

### OAuth Scopes

The Continue Slack app requests the following permissions:

- `app_mentions:read` - To detect when you mention @Continue
- `chat:write` - To send messages and responses
- `users:read` - To look up user information
- `users:read.email` - To match Slack users to Continue accounts
- `channels:read` - To access channel information
- `channels:history` - To read thread context

### Data Handling

- **Thread content**: Captured and stored as part of agent metadata to provide context
- **Messages**: Processed in real-time; not permanently stored by the Slack integration
- **Tokens**: Encrypted and stored securely in the Continue database
- **Repository access**: Controlled by GitHub App permissions, separate from Slack

### Disconnecting

To remove the Slack integration:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Find your Slack integration
3. Click "Disconnect"

This will:
- Revoke the OAuth token
- Stop Continue from accessing your Slack workspace
- Remove stored integration data

## Advanced Features

### Source Tracking

Agents started from Slack are tracked with a special source identifier format:

```
slack:{org|user}:{slug}:{channelId}:{threadTs}:{teamId}
```

This allows Continue to:
- Link agents back to their originating Slack thread
- Group agents by Slack team or channel
- Provide analytics on Slack-triggered agents

### Webhook Processing

The Slack integration uses Slack's Events API with the following optimizations:

- **Retry handling**: Duplicate events from Slack retries are ignored
- **Processing timeouts**: Webhook responses are sent within 3 seconds to comply with Slack's requirements
- **Background processing**: Agent creation happens asynchronously after acknowledging the webhook

### Thread Permalinks

Continue generates structured prompts that include a permanent link to the Slack thread, allowing the agent to reference the full conversation context if needed.
