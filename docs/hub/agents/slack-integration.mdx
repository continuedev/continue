<Info>

  Continue's Slack Agent allows you to start and manage Continue agents directly from your Slack workspace. When you summon @Continue inside an ongoing Slack thread, it automatically uses the entire conversation as context, so your agent starts with full situational awareness. This feature is currently in beta.

</Info>

## Overview

Mention @Continue in any channel with a task description, and it will:

- Create a new development agent
- Clone and work on your Repository
- Generate code changes and create pull requests
- Keep you updated on progress

- Quick bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Automated development tasks

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect GitHub">

    Click "Connect" next to GitHub in the Integrations settings, and grant access to the repositories you want Continue to work with.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Slack">

    Click the "Connect" button next to Slack and authorize the app in your workspace.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Default Repository (Optional)">

    Use the repository selector within the Slack tile to select a default repository for Continue Agents to work in.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Starting an Agent

To kick off an agent, mention `@Continue` with a description of what needs to be done.

<Tip>

  Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:

  ✅ **Good**: `@Continue Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`

  ❌ **Poor**: `@Continue fix auth`

</Tip>

<Accordion title="Agent Context">

  Continue captures the context of your Slack thread when creating an agent. If mentioned directly in a channel, it will respond in the thread and not have context other than the first message.

  The agent can also use a Slack MCP to dynamically send updates and retrieve more context if needed.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Repository Selection">

  Continue determines which repo to work in with the following precedence:

  1. **Specify in message**: Add `repo=repo-name` to your message. The repository name should match one of your GitHub repositories that the Continue GitHub App has access to.

  ```
  @Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug
  ```

  2. **Default repo**: Uses the default repo if set in the integration settings

  3. **Interactive selection**: Continue will follow up with a dropdown to select a repository

</Accordion>

### Sending Follow-up Messages

Once an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread:

```
@Continue Also add error handling for edge cases
```

Continue will forward your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one. For older threads, with no running agent, a new agent will be created.

## Monitoring Agent Progress

Click the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/agents).

You can also click the Slack icon in the agents page to return to the Slack message.

## Disconnecting

To remove the Slack integration:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Find your Slack integration
3. Click "Disconnect"
