<Info>
  The Slack integration allows you to start and manage Continue agents directly from your Slack workspace. This is currently in beta.
</Info>

## Overview

Continue brings AI-powered development agents to your Slack workspace. Mention @Continue in any channel with a task description, and it will:
- Create a new development agent
- Clone and work on your Repository
- Generate code changes and create pull requests
- Keep you updated on progress

The Slack bot is great for:
- Quick bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Automated development tasks

## Setup

Continue's Slack Bot can be installed to a Slack workspace via the Hub, from:
- [Personal Integrations Settings](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations) or
- Org Integrations Settings - `https://hub.continue.dev/organizations/{your-org-slug}/settings/integrations`

1. First, connect Github by clicking "Connect" next to GitHub in the Integrations settings, and granting access to the repositories you want Continue to work with
2. Click the "Connect" button next to Slack and authorize the app in your workspace
3. Optionally, use the repository selector within the Slack tile to select a default repo for Continue Agents to work in

## Usage

### Starting an Agent

To kick off an agent, mention `@Continue` with a description of what needs to be done.

Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:

✅ **Good**: `@Continue Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`

❌ **Poor**: `@Continue fix auth`

#### Agent context

Continue captures the context of your Slack thread when creating an agent. If mentioned directly in a channel, it will respond in the thread and not have context other than the first message.

The agent can also use a Slack MCP to dynamically send updates and retrieve more context if needed.

#### Repo selection

Continue determines which repo to work in with the following precedence:
1. You can specify a repository to work in by adding `repo=repo-name` to your message. The repository name should match one of your GitHub repositories that the Continue GitHub App has access to.

```
@Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug
```

2. A default repo, if set in the integration settings

3. Otherwise, it will follow up with a dropdown to select a repository to work in.

### Sending Follow-up Messages

Once an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread:

```
@Continue Also add error handling for edge cases
```

Continue will forward your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one. For older threads, with no running agent, a new agent will be created.

## Monitoring Agent Progress

Click the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/agents).

You can also click the Slack icon in the agents page to return to the Slack message.

## Disconnecting

To remove the Slack integration:

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)
2. Find your Slack integration
3. Click "Disconnect"
