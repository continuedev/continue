## How to Create an AI Agent from Scratch

To create an agent from scratch, select “New agent” in the top bar.

Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your agent.

The easiest way to create an agent is to click "Create agent" with the default configuration and then add / remove blocks using the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can edit the agent YAML directly before clicking "Create agent". Refer to examples of agents on [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev) and visit the [YAML Reference](/reference#complete-yaml-config-example) docs for more details.

## How to Remix an Agent

You can also create an agent by remixing an existing one. This is useful if you want to start with a pre-configured agent and make modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to

1. add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
2. change the name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create agent” will make this agent available for use.
