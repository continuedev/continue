## Creating an Agent

  ![Create an agent gif](/docs/images/hub/create-an-agent.gif)


<Steps>
  <Step title="ðŸ§­ Navigate to Create Agent">
    From the Continue Hub top navigation bar, select **"+"** â†’ **"New Agent"**.
    
    This opens the **Create an Agent (beta)** form with all required fields.

  </Step>

  <Step title="ðŸ§© Fill Out the Agent Form">
    Configure your agent with the following fields:

    | Field | What to Enter | Example |
    |-------|---------------|---------|
    | **Name** | Display name shown in the Hub | `GitHub PR Agent` |
    | **Prompt** | First instruction the agent receives | `Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue.` |
    | **Description** | What the agent does | `Creates a pull request and includes AI-generated summaries.` |
    | **Tools (MCPs)** | Select built-in or custom MCPs | `GitHub, PostHog, Supabase` |
    | **Rules** | Add any organizational rules | `continuedev/gh-pr-commit-workflow, continuedev/summarization` |
    | **Model** | Choose a default LLM | `Claude Sonnet 4.5` |
    | **Owner + Slug** | Determines namespace | `my-org/github-pr-agent` |
    | **Visibility** | Access level | `Public, Organization, or Private` |

    <Info>
      **Tip**: Start with a simple prompt and add complexity through rules and tools. The prompt should be a clear, single instruction that defines the agent's primary goal.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="ðŸ’¡ Preview the Configuration">
    As you fill in the fields, the right-hand panel shows a live preview of your agent's YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Open PR with Fix
    description: Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue
    tools: built_in, anthropic/github-mcp
    rules:
      - continuedev/gh-pr-commit-workflow
      - continuedev/summarization
    model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
    visibility: public
    ```

    This preview helps you verify the configuration before creating the agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="âœ… Create and Test">
    Click **"Create Agent"** to save and publish it.
    
    Your agent is immediately available to run in:
    - Mission Control web interface
    - TUI mode: `cn --agent your-org/your-agent-name`
    - Headless mode: `cn --agent -p your-org/your-agent-name "prompt" --auto`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Agent doesn't complete tasks** | Simplify the prompt, add more specific instructions, verify tool permissions |
| **Tools aren't working** | Check MCP configuration, verify API keys and permissions in Hub settings |
| **Inconsistent behavior** | Add rules to enforce consistent patterns, test with various input scenarios |
| **Performance issues** | Consider model choice, simplify complex multi-step workflows, optimize tool usage |
