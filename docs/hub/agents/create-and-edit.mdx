<Card title="🧱 Creating Custom Agents" icon="wrench">
  You can only create and edit Agents through Mission Control in the Continue Hub web interface. 
  This ensures proper validation, versioning, and team collaboration features.
</Card>

## Creating an Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="🧭 Navigate to Create Agent">
    From the Continue Hub top navigation bar, select **"+"** → **"New Agent"**.
    
    This opens the **Create an Agent (beta)** form with all required fields.
  </Step>

  <Step title="🧩 Fill Out the Agent Form">
    Configure your agent with the following fields:

    | Field | What to Enter | Example |
    |-------|---------------|---------|
    | **Name** | Display name shown in the Hub | `Open PR with Fix` |
    | **Prompt** | First instruction the agent receives | `Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue.` |
    | **Description** | What the agent does | `Creates a pull request and includes AI-generated summaries.` |
    | **Tools (MCPs)** | Select built-in or custom MCPs | `GitHub, PostHog, Supabase` |
    | **Rules** | Add any organizational rules | `continuedev/gh-pr-commit-workflow, continuedev/summarization` |
    | **Model** | Choose a default LLM | `Claude Sonnet 3.5` |
    | **Owner + Slug** | Determines namespace | `my-org/github-pr-agent` |
    | **Visibility** | Access level | `Public, Organization, or Private` |

    <Info>
      **Tip**: Start with a simple prompt and add complexity through rules and tools. The prompt should be a clear, single instruction that defines the agent's primary goal.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="💡 Preview the Configuration">
    As you fill in the fields, the right-hand panel shows a live preview of your agent's YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    name: Open PR with Fix
    description: Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue
    tools: built_in
    rules:
      - continuedev/gh-pr-commit-workflow
      - continuedev/summarization
    model: Claude Sonnet 3.5
    visibility: public
    ```

    This preview helps you verify the configuration before creating the agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="✅ Create and Test">
    Click **"Create Agent"** to save and publish it.
    
    Your agent is immediately available to run in:
    - Mission Control web interface
    - TUI mode: `cn --agent your-org/your-agent-name`
    - Headless mode: `cn --agent your-org/your-agent-name "prompt" --auto`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing an Agent

You can edit any agent you own or that belongs to your organization.

<Steps>

## Agent Components Deep Dive

### Writing Effective Prompts

Your prompt is the agent's primary instruction. Follow these patterns for best results:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task-Oriented Prompts">
    **Good**: Clear, actionable instructions
    ```
    Analyze the Sentry errors from the past 24 hours and create GitHub issues 
    for any critical bugs with suggested fixes and reproduction steps.
    ```
    
    **Avoid**: Vague or open-ended requests  
    ```
    Look at errors and do something about them.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context-Aware Prompts">
    **Good**: Include relevant context and constraints
    ```
    Review the React components in src/components/ for accessibility issues.
    Focus on ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
    Create a summary report with specific file locations and fix suggestions.
    ```
    
    **Avoid**: Assumptions about available context
    ```
    Fix the accessibility problems.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Step Workflows">
    **Good**: Break complex tasks into clear steps
    ```
    For the user authentication refactor:
    1. Audit current auth implementation for security issues
    2. Design improved architecture with proper session management  
    3. Create migration plan with backwards compatibility
    4. Open PR with implementation and comprehensive tests
    ```
    
    **Avoid**: Complex tasks without structure
    ```
    Refactor the authentication system to be better.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Choosing Rules

Rules enforce consistent behavior across all agent runs. Popular rule categories:

| Rule Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Code Quality** | Maintain standards | `continuedev/test-coverage`, `continuedev/code-review-checklist` |
| **Security** | Apply security practices | `continuedev/security-first`, `continuedev/vulnerability-scanning` |
| **Team Workflow** | Follow processes | `continuedev/pr-template`, `continuedev/commit-conventions` |
| **Custom** | Organization-specific | `my-org/deployment-rules`, `my-org/documentation-standards` |

### Selecting Tools (MCPs)

MCPs provide agents with external system access:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Testing Your Agent

Before deploying agents for team use, test thoroughly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="🧪 Local Testing">
    Use TUI mode to interact with your agent:
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent your-org/new-agent
    # Chat interactively to test behavior
    # Verify tool integrations work correctly
    # Check that rules are applied properly
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="🔍 Edge Case Testing">
    Test with various scenarios:
    
    ```bash
    # Test with minimal input
    cn --agent your-org/new-agent "Fix authentication"
    
    # Test with detailed context  
    cn --agent your-org/new-agent "Fix the authentication timeout issue in src/auth/session.js affecting mobile users"
    
    # Test error handling
    cn --agent your-org/new-agent "Invalid request that should fail gracefully"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="🎯 Production Readiness">
    Verify production requirements:
    
    - [ ] Agent completes tasks without manual intervention
    - [ ] Error handling is robust and informative
    - [ ] Output format meets team expectations
    - [ ] Security and permissions are properly configured
    - [ ] Performance is acceptable for intended use cases
  </Step>
</Steps>

    Begin with basic prompts and single tools. Add complexity gradually as you learn what works for your use cases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Choose clear, specific names that indicate the agent's purpose: `security-scanner-weekly` vs `scanner`.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="git-branch">
    Make incremental changes and test thoroughly. Agent versioning helps track what works.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Team Feedback" icon="users">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Agent doesn't complete tasks** | Simplify the prompt, add more specific instructions, verify tool permissions |
| **Tools aren't working** | Check MCP configuration, verify API keys and permissions in Hub settings |
| **Inconsistent behavior** | Add rules to enforce consistent patterns, test with various input scenarios |
| **Performance issues** | Consider model choice, simplify complex multi-step workflows, optimize tool usage |
