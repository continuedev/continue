## Steps to Use an AI Agent in Continue

Once you've found the agent you want to use on Continue Hub:

2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)
3. Select “Save changes” in agent sidebar on the right hand side

After saving, open your IDE extension and:

- Select the agent from the **agent dropdown** in the Continue extension.
