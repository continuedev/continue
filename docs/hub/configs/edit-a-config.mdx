First, select a config from the dropdown at the top.

While editing a config, you can explore the hub and click "Add Block" from a block page to add it to your config.

For blocks that require secret values like API keys, you will see a small notification on the block's tile in the sidebar that will indicate if action is needed.

To delete a block, click the trash icon.

If a block you want to use does not exist yet, you can [create a new block](/hub/configs/create-a-block).

When you are done editing, click "Publish" to publish a new version of the config.

Click "Open VS Code" or "Open JetBrains" to open your IDE for using the config.
