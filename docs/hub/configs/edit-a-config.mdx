First, select a config either from the Hub search or one that you've installed.

While editing a config, you can explore the hub and click "+" to add it to your config.

For tools or models that require secret values like API keys, you will see a small notification on the block's tile that will indicate if action is needed.

To delete part of your config, you can remove it from the yaml.

If a rule, prompt, or tool you want to use does not exist yet, you can [create it](/hub/introduction#creating-components).

When you are done editing, click "Publish" to publish a new version of the config.

Reload your terminal or IDE to use the latest version of the config in your agents.
