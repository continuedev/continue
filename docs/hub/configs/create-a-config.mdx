## How to Create a Config from Scratch

To create an config from scratch, select “New config” in the top bar.

Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your config.

The easiest way to create an config is to click "Create config" with the default configuration and then add / remove blocks using the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can edit the config YAML directly before clicking "Create config". Refer to examples of configs on [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev) and visit the [YAML Reference](/reference#complete-yaml-config-example) docs for more details.



## How to Remix a Config

You can also create an config by remixing an existing one. This is useful if you want to start with a pre-configured config and make modifications.

By clicking the “remix” button, you’ll be taken to the “Create a remix” page.

Once here, you’ll be able to

1. add or remove blocks in YAML configuration
2. change the name, description, icon, etc.

Clicking “Create config” will make this config available for use.
