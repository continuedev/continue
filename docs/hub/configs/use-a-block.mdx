Prompts, rules, models, MCP servers, etc. can be combined in Continue Hub to create a custom configuration. Learn more:

- [Create a configuration](/hub/configs/create-a-config)
- [Edit a configuration](/hub/configs/edit-a-config)

Some configurations require inputs. If you are missing an input for a configuration, a notification icon will show up in the sidebar next to the model, MCP server, etc. Click the notification to select which secret to use for the input:
