## What Are Configs?

Configs are flexible containers that combine multiple components to create powerful AI coding experiences using the Continue CLI or the Extensions. A single config can include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Models" icon="cube">
    
    Large Language Models for chat, autocomplete, editing, and more
    
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="MCPs" icon="wrench">
    
    Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities
    
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rules" icon="shield">
    
    Guidelines that shape AI behavior and responses
    
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Prompts" icon="message-square">
    
    Reusable instructions for common coding tasks
    
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## How Configs Work

Think of configs as recipes for AI assistance. Each config defines:

- **What models** to use for different tasks (chat, autocomplete, code editing)
- **Which tools** are available through MCP servers
- **How the AI behaves** through rules and guidelines  
- **Pre-built prompts** for common workflows

This flexibility lets you create specialized setups for different contexts, like a Next.js config with React-specific rules and tools, or a data science config with Python analysis capabilities.

## Config Permissions

When creating configs, you can set visibility levels:

- **Personal**: Only you can see and use the config
- **Public**: Anyone can discover and use your config
- **Organization**: Members of your organization can access the config

## Working with Configs

You can interact with configs in three main ways:

- **Create**: Build a new config from scratch or start with a template
- **Edit**: Modify your existing configs by adding/removing components
- **Remix**: Take someone else's config and customize it for your needs

## Getting Started

<Steps>

  <Step title="Explore existing configs">
    
    Browse the [Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/?type=assistants) to see what configs others have built
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a config to your account">
    
    Click "Install Config" (+) on any config that interests you
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize as needed">
    
    Add your API keys and customize components to match your workflow
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use in your IDE">
    
    Select the config from the dropdown in your Continue extension, type `/config` in the CLI, or use `--config` with the CLI commands
    
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Config Format

All configs follow the [`config.yaml`](/reference) format, whether you're using the hub interface or editing files locally. This ensures consistency between hub-managed and local configurations.
