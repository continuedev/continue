[Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) is the place to discover, configure, and govern your custom prompts, models, rules, MCP tools, and agents.

Continue Hub provides a centralized platform for managing the essential building blocks of your AI coding workflow:

- **[Models](/hub/configs/block-types#models)**: Discover and configure models from various providers
- **[MCP Tools](/hub/configs/block-types#mcp-servers)**: Access and integrate Model Context Protocol tools to retrieve real-time data and take action
- **[Rules](/hub/configs/block-types#rules)**: Define custom guidelines, constraints, policies, etc. for the solution
- **[Prompts](/hub/configs/block-types#prompts)**: Create and share reusable instructions that kickoff an agent
- **[Configs](/hub/configs/intro)**: a prompt and model that can be configured with rules and MCP tools to complete a task

Continue Hub also makes it easy for engineering leaders to centrally [set up](/hub/secrets/secret-types) and [govern](/hub/governance/org-permissions) these resources for their organization.
