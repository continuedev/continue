[Continue Hub](https://hub.continue.dev) is the place to discover, configure, and govern the models, rules, and MCP tools you need to create a custom AI coding agent.

Continue Hub provides a centralized platform for managing the essential building blocks of your AI coding workflow:

- **[Models](/hub/blocks/block-types#models)**: Discover and configure models from various providers
- **[MCP Tools](/hub/blocks/block-types#mcp-servers)**: Access and integrate Model Context Protocol tools to retrieve real-time data and take action
- **[Rules](/hub/blocks/block-types#rules)**: Define custom guidelines for your custom AI coding agent to follow
- **[Prompts](/hub/blocks/block-types#prompts)**: Create and share reusable prompts that kickoff your custom AI coding agent

Continue Hub also makes it easy for engineering leaders to centrally [configure](/hub/secrets/secret-types) and [govern](/hub/governance/org-permissions) these resources for their organization.
