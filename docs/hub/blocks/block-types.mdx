## Models

Models are blocks that let you specify Large Language Models (LLMs) and other deep learning models to be used for various roles in the open-source IDE extension like Chat, Autocomplete, Edit, Embed, Rerank, etc. You can explore available models on [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models).

Continue supports [many model providers](/customize/model-providers), including Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, Azure, xAI, DeepSeek, and more. Models can have one or more of the following roles depending on its capabilities, including `chat`, `edit`, `apply`, `autocomplete`, `embed`, and `rerank`. Read more about roles [here](/customize/model-roles). View [`models`](/reference#models) in the YAML Reference for more details.



## MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models. MCP Servers can be defined in `mcpServers` blocks. [Explore MCP Servers](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/mcp) on the hub.

Learn more in the [MCP deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/mcp), and view [`mcpServers`](/reference#mcpservers) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## Rules

Rules blocks are instructions that your custom AI code agent will always keep in mind - the contents of rules are inserted into the system message for all Chat requests. [Explore rules](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/rules) on the hub.

Learn more in the [rules deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/rules), and view [`rules`](/reference#rules) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## Prompts

Prompts blocks are pre-written, reusable prompts that can be referenced at any time during chat. They are especially useful as context for repetitive and/or complex tasks. [Explore prompts](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/prompts) on the hub.

Prompt blocks are pre-written, reusable prompts that can be referenced at any time during chat. They are especially useful as context for repetitive and/or complex tasks. [Explore prompts](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/prompts) on the hub.
Prompt blocks have the same syntax as [prompt files](/customize/deep-dives/prompts). The `config.yaml` spec for `prompts` can be found [here](/reference#prompts).
