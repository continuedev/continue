## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

This quickstart uses a template repository, but you can also follow these steps 2-4 from an existing repository.

### 1. Create a new repository from the template[​](#1-create-a-new-repository-from-the-template "Direct link to 1. Create a new repository from the template")

As shown in the image below, start by creating a new repository from [the template](https://github.com/continuedev/continue-hub-template). Click "Use Template" and then "Create a new repository".

### 2. Obtain a deploy key[​](#2-obtain-a-deploy-key "Direct link to 2. Obtain a deploy key")

Deploy keys allow the GitHub Action to authenticate with hub.continue.dev. [Obtain your deploy key here](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys) and then [create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) named `CONTINUE_API_KEY` in your GitHub repository.

### 3. Configure the GitHub Action[​](#3-configure-the-github-action "Direct link to 3. Configure the GitHub Action")

<Check>
  This step assumes you have already created an organization on
  hub.continue.dev. If not, learn more [here](/hub/governance/creating-an-org).
</Check>

In the repository you created, navigate to `.github/workflows/main.yaml` and update the lines below to match your organization:

```
env:  OWNER_SLUG: my-org-slug # <-- TODO
```

This is the only configuration necessary, but you can view the full list of options [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue-publish-action/blob/main/README.md).

### 4. Commit and push[​](#4-commit-and-push "Direct link to 4. Commit and push")

Add the [YAML for your assistants and blocks](/reference) to the appropriate directories:

- `assistants/public` for public assistants
- `assistants/private` for private (visible only within your organization) assistants
- `blocks/public` for public blocks
- `blocks/private` for private blocks

Then, commit and push your changes. Once the GitHub Action has completed running, you should be able to view the assistants within your organization on hub.continue.dev.
