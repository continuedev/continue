Continue makes this easy with a  that automatically syncs your YAML files with hub.continue.dev. We are also planning on adding automations for GitLab, BitBucket, Gitee, and others.

## Quickstart

This quickstart uses a template repository, but you can also follow these steps 2-4 from an existing repository.

### 1. Create a new repository from the template

As shown in the image below, start by creating a new repository from [the template](https://github.com/continuedev/continue-hub-template). Click "Use Template" and then "Create a new repository".

### 2. Obtain a deploy key

Deploy keys allow the GitHub Action to authenticate with hub.continue.dev. [Obtain your deploy key here](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys) and then [create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) named `CONTINUE_API_KEY` in your GitHub repository.

### 3. Configure the GitHub Action

<Check>
  This step assumes you have already created an organization on
  hub.continue.dev. If not, learn more [here](/hub/governance/creating-an-org).
</Check>

In the repository you created, navigate to `.github/workflows/main.yaml` and update the lines below to match your organization:

```
env:  OWNER_SLUG: my-org-slug # <-- TODO
```

This is the only configuration necessary, but you can view the full list of options [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue-publish-action/blob/main/README.md).

### 4. Commit and push

Add the [YAML for your agents and blocks](/reference) to the appropriate directories. The name of the file will be the slug of the agent/block.

- `assistants/public` for public agents
- `assistants/private` for private (visible only within your organization) agents
- `blocks/public` for public blocks
- `blocks/private` for private blocks

Then, commit and push your changes. Once the GitHub Action has completed running, you should be able to view the agents within your organization on hub.continue.dev. For subsequent changes, make sure to increment the `version` property of your updated YAML file(s).
