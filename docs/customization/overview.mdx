Continue can be deeply customized to fit your specific development workflow and preferences. This guide covers the main ways you can customize Continue to enhance your coding experience.

## Change Your Model Provider

Continue allows you to choose your favorite or even add multiple model providers. This allows you to use different models for different tasks, or to try another model if you're not happy with the results from your current model. Continue supports all of the popular model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft/Azure, Mistral, and more. You can even self host your own model provider if you'd like. Learn more about [model providers](/customize/model-providers/top-level/openai).

## Select Different Models for Specific Tasks

Different Continue features can use different models. We call these _model roles_. For example, you can use a different model for chat than you do for autocomplete. Learn more about [model roles](/customize/model-roles).

## Create a Slash Command

Slash commands allow you to easily add custom functionality to Continue. You can use a slash command that allows you to generate a shell command from natural language, or perhaps generate a commit message, or create your own custom command to do whatever you want. Learn more about [slash commands](/customize/deep-dives/slash-commands).

## Call External Tools and Functions

Unchain your LLM with the power of tools using [Agent](/features/agent/quick-start). Add custom tools using [MCP Servers](/customization/mcp-tools)

Whatever you choose, you'll probably start by editing your Agent.

## Edit Your Agent

You can easily access your agent configuration from the Continue Chat sidebar. Open the sidebar by pressing `cmd/ctrl` + `L` (VS Code) or `cmd/ctrl` + `J` (JetBrains) and click the Agent selector above the main chat input. Then, you can hover over an agent and click the `new window` (hub agents) or `gear` (local agents) icon.
