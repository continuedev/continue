## What are Cloud Agents?
Cloud Agents are AI workflows that execute on remote infrastructure (Continue Mission Control) rather than your local machine. Because they live in the cloud, they maintain persistent, secure connections to your development tools and can be triggered in two ways:

- On-Demand: Manually triggered via Chat, Tasks, or the CLI for complex, human-guided work.

- Automated: Automatically triggered by schedules (Cron) or events (Webhooks) for background maintenance.

Unlike local assistants, Cloud Agents provide a centralized "Mission Control" where teams can collaborate on tasks, review shared logs, and standardize automation across repositories.


<Card title="Agents in Continue" icon="robot">
  Agents are custom AI workflows that combine a prompt, rules, and tools (MCPs and more) to complete specific, repeatable tasks.
  They live in the Continue Mission Control and can be executed from Mission Control (web interface), TUI mode, or headless automation.
</Card>



## Ways to Run Cloud Agents

These execution modes allow Continue agents to function as cloud agents, running continuously, headlessly, or on schedules without requiring a developer in the loop:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🌐 Mission Control">
    **Interactive web interface**

    Trigger from the Continue Mission Control and review results in real-time.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to hub.continue.dev/agents
    # Click "Run Agent" on any agent
    # Monitor progress and review outputs
    ```

    Perfect for: Interactive debugging, reviewing agent outputs, team collaboration
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="💻 TUI Mode">
    **Interactive terminal mode**

    Launch from terminal for live interaction and testing.

    ```bash
    cn --agent my-org/github-pr-agent
    # Interactive chat interface opens
    # Type your specific request
    # Review and approve actions
    ```

    Perfect for: Local development, testing prompts, quick one-off tasks
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🤖 Headless Mode">
    **Automated execution**

    Run one-off or scheduled tasks automatically without interaction.

    ```bash
    cn -p --agent my-org/snyk-agent "Run weekly security scan"
    ```

    Perfect for: CI/CD pipelines, scheduled tasks, webhook integrations
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="📁 Local Agents">
    **Version-controlled agents in your repository**

    Define agents in `.continue/agents/` and run them with the CLI or GitHub Actions.

    ```bash
    # Run a local agent file
    cn --agent .continue/agents/my-agent.md
    ```

    Perfect for: Team-shared workflows, CI/CD automation, version-controlled agent definitions

## Local vs. Cloud Agents

| Feature | Local Agents (IDE / TUI) | Cloud Agents (Mission Control) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Compute Location | Your Local Machine | Remote Cloud Infrastructure |
| Primary Use Case | fast, private iteration and "single-player" coding | Collaborative tasks, heavy processing, and reliable automation |
| Context Access | Limited to open files and local git state | Full repository access + integrated tools (Sentry, Snyk, etc.) |
| Triggers | Manual Tasks / CLI | Hybrid: Manual Chat, Cron Schedules, or Event Webhooks |
| Availability | Stops when you close your laptop | Always On: Runs asynchronously in the background |

{/* ## Webhook Integrations

Trigger Agents automatically through secure webhooks for CI/CD integration:

```bash
POST /webhooks/ingest/:webhookId
{
  "payload": { "trigger": "nightly-security-scan" }
}
```

Perfect for connecting with:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Monitoring alerts (Sentry, DataDog)
- Deployment pipelines
- Scheduled maintenance tasks */}

## Collaboration

Agents are organizational assets — once created, everyone in your org can use them:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Public** | Use, create, remix, and delete Agents |
| **Organization** | Share agents with your team |
| **Private** | Create, edit, and delete Agents for your personal use |

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Try a Pre-configured Agent">
    Start with a cookbook agent like `continuedev/github-project-manager-agent`:
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent continuedev/github-project-manager-agent "List open issues labeled bug"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Practice with TUI Mode">
    Test agents locally before automation:
    
    ```bash
    cn --agent continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent
    # Interactive mode - perfect for learning how to use the agent for your use case
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    Ready to build custom workflows? Learn how in our [Create and Edit guide](/agents/create-and-edit).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Automation">
    Integrate with CI/CD using headless mode and webhooks for continuous workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring

You can monitor all activity for your Agents directly in **Mission Control**.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Inbox Overview">
    The **Inbox** shows every Task or Workflow run, and you can filter by Agent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Detailed Session View">
    Click any session in the Inbox to open the Detail page.  

    Each session includes:
    - **Summary** — what the agent did and why  
    - **Diff** — generated code changes  
    - **Logs** — full execution trace, tool calls, and reasoning  

    This is the best way to review output, debug issues, or confirm correctness.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
All monitoring is scoped to your current workspace.

## Best Practices

The practice of using cloud agents, which we call Continuous AI, requires forethought to set up the right guardrails:

- **Start Small**: Begin with tasks you're confident Continue can accomplish
- **Use Thorough Prompts**: Agents can run for extended periods, so invest in detailed instructions  
- **Test Locally First**: Practice with TUI mode before deploying to production
- **Team Alignment**: Discuss agent usage and adjust code review habits for higher PR volume
- **Iterate and Improve**: Be willing to refine prompts based on results
