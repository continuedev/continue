title: "Agents"
---

Agents use the same markdown file format as checks. The difference: agents support an `on:` field in frontmatter for triggering on events beyond PR open — cron schedules, GitHub issues, Sentry alerts, Slack messages, webhooks.

## Local agents vs. cloud agents

There are two ways to define agents:

- **Local**: Place agent files in `.continue/agents/` in your repository. Version-controlled and shared with your team.
- **Cloud**: Created and managed on [continue.dev/agents](https://continue.dev/agents). Web UI for configuration, no file to commit.

Both run on Continue's cloud infrastructure.

## The `on:` field

The `on:` field in agent frontmatter defines what triggers the agent:

| Trigger | Description |
|---|---|
| `pr_opened` | When a pull request is opened (this is what checks do implicitly) |
| `issue_opened` | When a new issue is created |
| `label_added` | When a label is applied to an issue or PR |
| `pr_merged` | When a pull request is merged |
| `check_failed` | When a CI check fails |
| `cron` | On a schedule |
| `webhook` | When an external webhook fires |

Example agent with a cron trigger:

```markdown
---
name: weekly-dependency-update
on:
  cron: "0 9 * * 1"
tools:
  - github
---

Check for outdated dependencies and open a PR with updates.
```

## Running agents

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mission Control">
    Trigger agents from the web interface at [continue.dev](https://continue.dev) and review results in real-time.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI interactive">
    ```bash
    cn --agent my-org/my-agent
    ```

    Opens an interactive chat session with the agent.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI headless">
    ```bash
    cn -p --agent my-org/my-agent "Run weekly security scan"
    ```

    Runs the agent non-interactively. Useful for CI/CD pipelines and scheduled automation.

## Checks vs. agents

| | Checks | Agents |
|---|---|---|
| File location | `.continue/checks/` | `.continue/agents/` or continue.dev |
| Trigger | Always on PR open | Configurable via `on:` field |
| Purpose | Pass/fail review of PRs | Any automated task |
