<Card title="🚀 Quick Start with Mission Control" icon="rocket">
  Mission Control is your web interface for running and managing Cloud Agents. Get started in minutes with pre-built workflows for security scanning, GitHub management, analytics insights, and more.
</Card>

<Info>
  Mission Control is in beta. Please share any feedback with us in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions/8051).
</Info>

Use Mission Control to kick off Cloud Agents for:
- **Bug fixes & code quality** - Address nitpicks and technical debt
- **Feature development** - Build boilerplate-heavy features  
- **Security & compliance** - [Automated vulnerability scanning](../mission-control/integrations/snyk)
- **Investigation & analysis** - Research issues to kickstart your work
- **Custom workflows** - Run repeatable tasks with your own rules and prompts

## Quick Start

<Tip>
  If you haven't already, create an account and connect your GitHub repositories in [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/).
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Agents Page">
    Go to [Mission Control Agents page](https://hub.continue.dev/agents) and select an existing workflow with a pre-configured Cloud Agent.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your First Cloud Agent">
    Your agents page lists all available Cloud Agents. Click on the agent and then **Test Run** to start it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Try a Cloud Agent First: Your 60-Second Challenge

Before creating your own agent, let's see one in action! The fastest way to experience the power of Continue agents is with our demo repository.

### See an Agent Create a Pull Request in Under 60 Seconds

<Steps>
  <Step title="🍴 Fork Our Demo Repository">
    Get a safe sandbox to experiment with:
    
    **Option 1: GitHub Web Interface**
    Visit [github.com/continuedev/demo-project](https://github.com/continuedev/demo-project) and click **Fork**
    
    **Option 2: GitHub CLI**
    ```bash
    gh repo fork continuedev/demo-project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="🎯 Access Mission Control">
    Go to [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/) and:
    - **Connect GitHub** and authorize Continue when prompted
    - This gives agents access to create PRs in your repositories
  </Step>

  <Step title="🚀 Run Your First Agent">
    **Target your forked demo repo** and try one of these commands as a [task](../mission-control/tasks):
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Add New Feature">
        ```
        Create a new function that calculates fibonacci numbers.
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Fix Existing Bug">
        ```
        Fix the TypeError in api/users.ts
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Add Documentation">
        ```
        Add comprehensive README documentation with setup instructions.
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="✨ Watch the Magic">
    **Result:** A fully-formed Pull Request opens in your demo repo with:
    - Complete implementation or fix
    - Proper commit messages
    - Detailed PR description
    - Ready for review and merge
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Why Use the Demo Repo?**
  - **Safe testing environment** - No risk to your production code
  - **Pre-configured issues** - Common bugs and features to practice with
  - **Immediate results** - See agents in action without setup complexity
  - **Learn by example** - Study the generated code and PR descriptions
</Info>

<Tip>
  Once you see how agents work with the demo repo, you'll understand exactly how to create and customize your own for real projects!
