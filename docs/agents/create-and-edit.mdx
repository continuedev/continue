## Creating a Cloud Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="🧭 Navigate to Create Agent">
    Navigate to the [New Agent page](https://hub.continue.dev/agents/new).
    

  </Step>

  <Step title="🧩 Fill Out the Agent Form">
    Configure your Cloud Agent with the following fields:

    | Field | What to Enter | Example |
    |-------|---------------|---------|
    | **Name** | Display name shown in Mission Control | `GitHub PR Agent` |
    | **Prompt** | First instruction the agent receives | `Open a GitHub PR to fix the specified issue.` |
    | **Tools ([MCPs](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=mcpServers))** | Select built-in or custom MCPs | `GitHub, PostHog, Supabase, etc.` |
    | **[Rules](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=rules)** | Add any organizational rules | `continuedev/gh-pr-commit-workflow` |
    | **[Model](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=models)** | Choose a default LLM | `Claude Sonnet 4.5` |
    | **Trigger** | Determines when the cloud agent will be invoked | `GitHub, cron, webhook` |
   

    <Info>
      **Tip**: Start with a simple prompt and add complexity through rules and tools. The prompt should be a clear, single instruction that defines the AI Agent's primary goal.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="💡 Choose Repository & Automation">
   In the right panel, you can select the repository where the agent will run, and decide if the agent should automatically kick off on creation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="✅ Create and Test">
    Click **"Create Agent"** to save and publish it.
    
    Your agent is immediately available to run in:
    - Mission Control web interface
    - TUI mode: `cn --agent your-org/your-agent-name`
    - Headless mode: `cn --agent -p your-org/your-agent-name "prompt" --auto`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing a Cloud Agent

You can edit any AI Agent you own or that has Organization-level access.

From the **[Agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents)** page, click your agent's name. Change any of the fields in the edit form, then click **"Save Changes"**.

| **Cloud Agent doesn't complete tasks** | Simplify the prompt, add more specific instructions, verify tool permissions |
| **Tools aren't working** | Check MCP configuration, verify API keys and permissions in Hub settings |
| **Inconsistent behavior** | Add rules to enforce consistent patterns, test with various input scenarios |
| **Performance issues** | Consider model choice, simplify complex multi-step workflows, optimize tool usage |
