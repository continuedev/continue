title: "Example Checks"
---

The fastest way to create checks is to ask your coding agent to write them. The prompts below are organized by category — paste any of them into Claude Code or your preferred coding agent. Because the agent can read your codebase, the result is tailored to your actual code.

## Discovery prompts

### Security

```
Look at our codebase and write checks for the most likely security issues — think auth bypasses, injection vectors, secrets in source, and missing input validation. Tailor the checks to the frameworks and patterns we actually use.
```

```
Write a check that verifies new API endpoints follow our existing auth middleware pattern
```

### Code review patterns

```
Look through our recent PR review comments and identify things reviewers say repeatedly. Write checks that automate those recurring review comments.
```

```
Read our CONTRIBUTING.md and any style guides in the repo, then write checks that enforce the conventions we've documented but reviewers still have to catch manually
```

### QA and browser testing

```
Write a check that uses a browser to verify any new or changed pages render without errors and match our design system
```

```
Write a check that visits any URLs added or changed in this PR, takes screenshots, and flags layout issues or broken links
```

### Best practices

```
Analyze our codebase and write checks for the patterns that matter most — error handling conventions, logging standards, naming conventions, or whatever you see us being inconsistent about
```

```
Write a check that makes sure database migrations are safe to run on a production table with 100M+ rows
```

### Test coverage

```
Write a check that verifies new code has corresponding tests, following the test file naming and structure conventions already in our project
```

### Documentation

```
Write a check that flags PRs where public API or configuration changes aren't reflected in documentation
```

## Static examples

Complete check files you can copy into `.continue/checks/` directly. These are generic starting points — checks generated by your coding agent from the prompts above will be more specific to your project.

### Security review

````markdown security-review.md
---
name: Security Review
description: Flag hardcoded secrets, injection vectors, and missing input validation
---

Review the pull request diff for security issues.

Flag as **failing** if any of these are true:

- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings in source files
- New API endpoints or request handlers without input validation or sanitization
- SQL queries built with string concatenation or template literals instead of parameterized queries
- Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) written to logs or stdout
- New cryptographic code using weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security purposes, ECB mode)
- Secrets added to files that are not in `.gitignore`

If none of these issues are found, pass the check.
````

### Test coverage

````markdown test-coverage.md
---
name: Test Coverage
description: Verify new code has corresponding tests
---

Review the pull request diff and check that new code is tested.

Flag as **failing** if any of these are true:

- A new source file was added without a corresponding test file (e.g., `utils.ts` added but no `utils.test.ts`)
- New exported functions or public methods have no test exercising them
- An existing test file was deleted without the corresponding source file also being deleted

Pass the check if:

- All new source files have corresponding test files
- New functions/methods are covered by at least one test
- Only test files, docs, or config files were changed
- The PR modifies existing code and existing tests still cover the changed paths
````

### Documentation freshness

````markdown docs-freshness.md
---
name: Documentation Freshness
description: Ensure docs are updated when public APIs or configuration changes
---

Review the pull request diff for changes to public-facing APIs or configuration, and verify documentation was updated.

Flag as **failing** if any of these are true:

- A public function, class, or type signature was added or changed, but no documentation file (README, docs/, or inline JSDoc/docstrings) was updated
- Configuration options were added or renamed (config files, environment variables, CLI flags) without updating the corresponding docs
- API route paths or request/response shapes changed without updating API documentation

Pass the check if:

- No public API or configuration changes were made
- Documentation files were updated in the same PR as the API/config change
- Changes are purely internal (private functions, refactors with no public interface change)
````

### Conventional commits

````markdown conventional-commits.md
---
name: Conventional Commits
description: Verify the PR title follows conventional commit format
---

Check that the pull request title follows the Conventional Commits specification.

The title must match this format: `type(optional scope): description`

Valid types:

- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `docs` — documentation only
- `style` — formatting, no code change
- `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` — performance improvement
- `test` — adding or updating tests
- `build` — changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci` — changes to CI configuration
- `chore` — maintenance tasks
- `revert` — reverts a previous commit

Flag as **failing** if:

- The PR title does not start with a valid type from the list above
- The type is not followed by a colon and a space
- The description after the colon is empty
- The type is capitalized (must be lowercase)

Pass the check if the PR title matches the format with a valid type prefix.

### Dependency audit

````markdown dependency-audit.md
---
name: Dependency Audit
description: Review new or updated dependencies for risk
---

Review the pull request diff for changes to dependency manifests (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, or similar).

If no dependency files were changed, pass the check.

When dependencies were added or updated, flag as **failing** if any of these are true:

- A new dependency has fewer than 100 GitHub stars or appears unmaintained (no commits in the last 12 months)
- A dependency was bumped by more than one major version (e.g., v2.x to v4.x) without a note in the PR description explaining the jump
- A known deprecated or security-flagged package was added
- A dependency was added that duplicates functionality already available from an existing dependency
- Dev dependencies were added to production dependency sections (e.g., a test framework in `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`)

Pass the check if:

- All new dependencies are well-maintained and widely used
- Version bumps are single major versions or minor/patch updates
- Dependency changes are documented in the PR description if non-trivial
````

### Migration safety

````markdown migration-safety.md
---
name: Migration Safety
description: Check database migrations for destructive operations
---

Review the pull request diff for database migration files (SQL migrations, ORM migration files like Alembic, Knex, ActiveRecord, Prisma, or similar).

If no migration files were added or changed, pass the check.

When migrations are present, flag as **failing** if any of these are true:

- `DROP TABLE` or `DROP COLUMN` without a preceding migration that backs up or migrates the data
- Column type narrowing (e.g., `TEXT` to `VARCHAR(50)`, `BIGINT` to `INT`) without a backfill step
- `NOT NULL` constraint added to an existing column without a `DEFAULT` value or a data backfill
- Renaming a column or table that is referenced by application code without updating that code in the same PR
- A destructive and a constructive change in the same migration file (split these into separate migrations for safe rollback)

Pass the check if:

- The migration only adds new tables, columns, or indexes
- Destructive operations include a clear backfill or data migration step
- The migration is idempotent (uses `IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` guards)
