title: "Run Checks Locally"
---

Run your checks locally before pushing to CI using the `/check` command in your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent that supports skills).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add continuedev/skills --skill check
```

## Run checks

Type `/check` in your coding agent. It discovers every check file in `.continue/checks/`, runs each one as a subagent against your current branch, and reports the results. To run a single check, pass the file path: `/check .continue/checks/security-review.md`.

```
/check
```

## Iterate on a check

The local feedback loop is: edit the check file, run `/check`, read the output, refine. Because checks run inside your coding agent, you can ask it to fix issues in the same session:

```
The migration safety check is flagging additive-only migrations as failures. Update the check to only flag destructive operations.
```

## Run checks automatically

You can add `/check` to your `AGENTS.md` so your coding agent runs checks automatically as part of its workflow — for example, after creating a PR:

```markdown AGENTS.md
After creating or updating a pull request, run /check and fix any failures before requesting review.
```

## Why local?

Running checks locally uses your existing coding agent and credits (Claude Max, API key, etc.). There's nothing extra to install or configure — if your agent can read your repo, it can run your checks.

For running checks automatically on every PR in CI, see [Run Checks in CI](/checks/running-in-ci).
