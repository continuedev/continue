title: "Run Checks Locally"
---

Run your checks locally before pushing to CI using the `/checks` command in your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent that supports skills).

## Run all checks

Type `/checks` in your coding agent. It discovers every check file in `.continue/checks/` (and `.agents/checks/`), runs each one as a subagent against your current branch, and reports the results.

```
/checks
```

Output looks like:

```
✓ Security Review — PASS
  No hardcoded secrets or SQL injection vectors found in the diff.

✗ Migration Safety — FAIL
  migrations/024_drop_legacy_users.sql drops the legacy_users table
  without a preceding data migration. Add a backfill step or split
  into two migrations.

✓ Test Coverage — PASS
  All new source files have corresponding test files.
```

## Run a single check

To run one specific check, pass the file path:

```
/checks .continue/checks/security-review.md
```

## Iterate on a check

The local feedback loop is: edit the check file, run `/checks`, read the output, refine. Because checks run inside your coding agent, you can ask it to fix issues in the same session:

```
The migration safety check is flagging additive-only migrations as failures. Update the check to only flag destructive operations.
```

## Automate with AGENTS.md

You can add `/checks` to your `AGENTS.md` so your coding agent runs checks automatically as part of its workflow — for example, after creating a PR:

```markdown AGENTS.md
After creating or updating a pull request, run /checks and fix any failures before requesting review.
```

## Why local?

Running checks locally uses your existing coding agent and credits (Claude Max, API key, etc.). There's nothing extra to install or configure — if your agent can read your repo, it can run your checks.

For running checks automatically on every PR in CI, see [Run Checks in CI](/checks/setup-on-continue).
