title: "Run Checks in CI"
---

Continue watches your repository for pull requests, runs each check defined in `.continue/checks/`, and reports results as GitHub status checks. A green check means the code passed; a red check means the code failed, with a suggested fix.

## Prerequisites

- A [Continue](https://continue.dev) account
- A GitHub repository with at least one check file in `.continue/checks/` (see [Write Your First Check](/checks/quickstart))

## Connect GitHub

1. Go to [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/) and sign in (or create an account).
2. Navigate to the [GitHub integration page](https://continue.dev/integrations/github).
3. Click **Connect GitHub** and authorize Continue.
4. Select the repositories you want Continue to monitor.

Once connected, Continue will start running checks on new pull requests in the selected repositories.

## How checks are discovered

Continue reads the `.continue/checks/` directory (or `.agents/checks/`) from your repository's default branch. Every `.md` file in that directory becomes a check that runs on every PR. No additional configuration is needed — commit a check file and it is active.

## The PR workflow

When a pull request is opened, reopened, or updated:

1. Each check file runs independently against the PR diff.
2. Results appear as GitHub status checks on the PR.
3. If a check passes, it shows a green checkmark.
4. If a check fails, it shows a red X with a suggested diff.
5. Click the check details link in GitHub to see the full reasoning on continue.dev.

## Accept or reject suggestions

When a check fails and suggests changes:

1. Click the check's **Details** link on the PR in GitHub. This opens the result on continue.dev.
2. Review the suggested diff.
3. **Accept** to apply the changes as a commit to the PR branch.
4. **Reject** to dismiss the suggestion. The check will re-run on the next push.

## Self-hosted alternative: GitHub Actions

If you prefer to run checks on your own infrastructure, use the reusable workflow instead of Continue's cloud:

```yaml .github/workflows/checks.yml
name: Run Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  checks:
    uses: continuedev/continue/.github/workflows/continue-agents.yml@main
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

This requires an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret in your repository settings (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**). The Continue cloud path described above does not require this — it uses your Continue account credentials.

For advanced GitHub integration options, see the [GitHub integration](/mission-control/integrations/github) page.
