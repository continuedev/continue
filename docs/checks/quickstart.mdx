title: "Write Your First Check"

## Generating checks (recommended)

Paste this into Claude Code or any coding agent:

```
Help me write checks for this codebase: https://continue.dev/walkthrough
```

The walkthrough reads your codebase, helps you write your first checks, connects you to Continue, and gets them running on your next PR. It takes a few minutes.

If you'd rather set things up manually, keep reading.

## Writing checks manually

A check file has two parts: **frontmatter** (YAML between `---` delimiters) with a required `name` and `description`, and a **body** prompt that tells the AI what to look for. Create a `.md` file in `.continue/checks/`:

```markdown .continue/checks/security-review.md
---
name: Security Review
description: Flag hardcoded secrets and missing input validation
---

Review this pull request for security issues.

Flag as failing if any of these are true:

- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source files
- New API endpoints without input validation
- SQL queries built with string concatenation
- Sensitive data logged to stdout

If none of these issues are found, pass the check.
```

Write concrete pass/fail criteria so the check produces consistent results. See the [reference](/checks/reference) for all available fields.
