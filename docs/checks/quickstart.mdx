title: "Write Your First Check"
---

## The walkthrough

Paste this into Claude Code or any coding agent:

```
Help me write checks for this codebase: https://continue.dev/walkthrough
```

The walkthrough reads your codebase, helps you write your first checks, connects you to Continue, and gets them running on your next PR. It takes a few minutes.

If you'd rather set things up manually, keep reading.

## Manual setup

### Create a check file

```bash
mkdir -p .continue/checks
```

Create `.continue/checks/security-review.md`:

```markdown .continue/checks/security-review.md
---
name: Security Review
description: Flag hardcoded secrets and missing input validation
---

Review this pull request for security issues.

Flag as failing if any of these are true:

- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source files
- New API endpoints without input validation
- SQL queries built with string concatenation
- Sensitive data logged to stdout

If none of these issues are found, pass the check.
```

A check file has two parts.

**Frontmatter** (YAML between `---` delimiters): `name` and `description` are required. See the [reference](/checks/reference) for all available fields.

**Body** (markdown after the frontmatter): the prompt the AI follows when reviewing a pull request. Write concrete pass/fail criteria so the check produces consistent results.

The path `.agents/checks/` is also supported as an open-standard alternative to `.continue/checks/`.
