title: "Generating Checks"
---

The best way to create checks is to have your coding agent write them. Install the writing-checks skill to teach your agent the check file format and best practices:

```bash
npx skills add continuedev/skills --skill writing-checks
```

Then describe what you want to enforce and the agent writes the check file, tailored to your actual frameworks, file structure, and conventions. Here are some prompts to try:

## Security

Catch vulnerabilities specific to your stack — auth gaps, injection vectors, leaked secrets.

```
Look at our codebase and write checks for the most likely security issues — think auth bypasses, injection vectors, secrets in source, and missing input validation. Tailor the checks to the frameworks and patterns we actually use.
```

## Code review patterns

Turn recurring PR feedback into automated checks so reviewers don't have to repeat themselves.

```
Look through our recent PR review comments and identify things reviewers say repeatedly. Write checks that automate those recurring review comments.
```

## QA and browser testing

Verify that UI changes render correctly and don't break links or layouts.

```
Write a check that uses a browser to verify any new or changed pages render without errors and match our design system
```

## Best practices

Enforce the conventions your team already follows — error handling, naming, migration safety.

```
Analyze our codebase and write checks for the patterns that matter most — error handling conventions, logging standards, naming conventions, or whatever you see us being inconsistent about
```

## Test coverage

Make sure new code ships with tests that match your project's existing patterns.

```
Write a check that verifies new code has corresponding tests, following the test file naming and structure conventions already in our project
```

## Documentation

Flag PRs where public APIs or config changed but the docs didn't.

```
Write a check that flags PRs where public API or configuration changes aren't reflected in documentation
```

## Iterate locally

Write the check (or have your agent write it), run it against a real PR branch, read the output, refine. Run `/checks` in your coding agent to test:

```
/checks .continue/checks/migration-safety.md
```

See [Run Checks Locally](/checks/running-locally) for the full local testing workflow.
