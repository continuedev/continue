The Continue Documentation MCP Server allows you to search and retrieve information from the Continue documentation directly within your agent conversations.

## Set Up

### Configure Continue

1. Create a folder called `.continue/mcpServers` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `continue-docs-mcp.yaml` to this folder
3. Write the following contents and save:

```yaml title=".continue/mcpServers/continue-docs-mcp.yaml"
name: Continue Documentation MCP
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - uses: continuedev/continue-docs-mcp
```

### Enable Agent Mode

MCP servers only work in agent mode. Make sure to switch to agent mode in Continue before testing.

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use the MCP server to search Continue documentation:

### Model Configuration Help

```
How do I add Claude 4 Sonnet as a model from Bedrock in Continue?
```

### Context Providers

```
What context providers are available in Continue?
```

### Customization

```
How do I add custom rules to my configuration in Continue?
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Loading

1. **Check configuration**: Ensure your YAML configuration uses the correct `uses` field with `continuedev/continue-docs-mcp`
2. **Check agent mode**: MCP servers only work in agent mode
3. **Restart Continue**: Try restarting the Continue extension

### No Search Results

1. **Verify connection**: The MCP server needs internet access to search the documentation
2. **Check query format**: Try rephrasing your search query
3. **Test with known topics**: Search for well-documented features like "model configuration"
