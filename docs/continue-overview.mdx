# Continue Agents - Complete Guide

<Card title="Agents in Continue" icon="robot">

  Agents are custom AI workflows that combine a prompt, rules, and tools (MCPs and more) to complete specific, repeatable tasks. They live in the Continue Mission Control and can be executed from Mission Control (web interface), TUI mode, or headless automation.

</Card>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Mission Control">
    
    Go to [hub.continue.dev/agents](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=agents) and connect with your GitHub account.
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose an Agent">
    
    Select from pre-configured agents or create your own
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your First Agent">
    
    Enter a prompt and watch your agent work
    
  </Step>
</Steps>


## What Are Agents?

Agents let your team standardize common workflows like opening GitHub PRs, summarizing analytics, or auditing security. Each agent includes:

### Agent Components

| **Component** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Prompt** | The agent's main instruction that defines what it does and how it should behave | "Summarize ongoing work with status, blockers, and next steps" |
| **Rules** | Define consistent standards or behaviors that guide how the agent responds | "Always include related issue or PR links when summarizing work" |
| **Tools / MCPs** | External systems or integrations the agent can call to complete tasks | GitHub, PostHog, Supabase |
| **Model** | The large language model that powers the agent's reasoning | Claude Sonnet 4.5 |
| **Visibility** | Determines who can view or use the agent | Public, Organization, or Private |

## Components Behind Mission Control

Agents are built from reusable components that you can create, share, and customize:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Models" icon="cube">
    Large Language Models from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) configured for specific roles like chat, autocomplete, or editing
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCPs" icon="wrench">
    Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities like database access, web search, or custom functions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rules" icon="shield">
    Guidelines that shape AI behavior - coding standards, constraints, or specific instructions for your domain
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompts" icon="message-square">
    Reusable instructions for common tasks, optimized for specific workflows or coding patterns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Components are the building blocks for agents that you can create new or remix from an existing component. When you create a component in mission control, it becomes available according to the permissions you set: Personal, Public, or Organization.

### Component Inputs

Some components can receive values, including secrets, as inputs through templating. For values that the user needs to set, you can use template variables (e.g. `${{ inputs.API_KEY}}`). Then, the user can set `API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}` in the `with` clause of their agent or config.

**Choosing between `secrets.` and `inputs.`**

When creating components for your Agent:
- Use `${{ inputs.INPUT_NAME }}` in your definition when you want users to be able to customize which secret is used
- Users will then map their own secrets using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the `with` clause

For personal or single-use configurations, you can skip the inputs layer and reference `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` directly.


## Tasks

A Task is a unit of work shared between you and an agent. You trigger the task, the agent executes it, then you review or approve the results. Tasks can run **on demand**, **on triggers**, or **on schedules**.

### Creating and Running a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Agent">
    Select the **Agent** you want to use for this task.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Repository">
    Pick the **repository** and **branch** where the Agent will work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the Task">
    Add your user input — clear instructions for what you want the agent to accomplish.
    
    Example prompts:
    - Refactor unused React components and clean up imports
    - Add error handling to all API endpoints in the /api directory
    - Update README with installation instructions for the new CLI tool
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Task">
    Click the Submit button. The Agent will analyze your repository, execute the task, generate changes, and create a detailed session log.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Each Task run creates a Session with complete traceability including Summary, Diff, and Logs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflows

Workflows trigger agents on a schedule or when events occur.

A Workflow automatically runs an Agent on a repository when:
- A schedule is reached (cron)
- An event occurs (webhook, e.g. GitHub PR)

Use Workflows for recurring or event-driven tasks like:
- Daily vulnerability scans
- Weekly changelog generation
- Reacting to new pull requests or Sentry alerts

### Creating a Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from scratch or a template">
    In Mission Control → Workflows, create a new workflow. You can start with a blank workflow or use a template like "Update agents.md", "Draft Changelog Updates", or "Solve Snyk Vulnerabilities".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Workflow">
    Give your Workflow a clear, descriptive name like "Morning status check" or "Weekly changelog draft".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repository & Agent">
    Choose the repository (the codebase) and the Agent that should perform the work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Trigger Type">
    Pick how this Workflow should run: Cron (schedule) or Webhook (external system events).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Trigger">
    For Cron: Select a schedule (daily, weekly, hourly, custom)
    For Webhook: Set up Secret Header and Value, then receive a webhook URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Workflow">
    Click Create to activate your workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monitoring Workflow Runs

Workflow runs show up just like Tasks - each execution creates a Session, workflows appear in your Inbox, and you can open the detail view to see the summary, diff, and logs.


## Metrics

Metrics give you visibility into how your Agents and Workflows perform across your repositories. Use this page to understand activity patterns, identify bottlenecks, and measure success over time.

### What Metrics Show

- **Activity (Last 14 Days)**: A day-by-day graph of total Agent runs across your repositories
- **Agent Statistics**: Per-Agent breakdown of total runs, PR creation rate, PR status, and success vs. intervention rate
- **Workflow Impact**: Track which Workflows create the most tasks or PRs, and how often they complete successfully

### Why Metrics Matter

- **Improve Agent Reliability**: Identify which Agents need better rules, tools, or prompts
- **Measure Automation Value**: See how much work your automated Workflows are completing across your repos

## Sharing

You can share any Agent or Component (Models, Rules, Prompts, MCP Servers) by publishing it as Public or Organization-visible. Sharing makes it easy for teammates—or the entire community—to reuse your best workflows.

### Where to Find Your Shareable Items

Your personal and organization components live in your Profile. To access your profile: Open Mission Control → Open the Organization Switcher in the top left sidebar nav → Select the Profile Icon.

Profiles look the same for personal users and organizations. The only difference is visibility options: personal profiles can create Public or Private items. Organizations can also create Organization-only items.

### Sharing Options

Each Agent or Component can be published with one of three visibility levels:

- **Personal (Private)**: Only you can see and use the item. Great for prototypes or experiments.
- **Organization**: Visible to everyone in your organization. Ideal for internal workflows, standardized agents, and shared tooling.
- **Public**: Available to everyone in Continue Mission Control. Perfect for templates, community contributions, and reusable examples.

### Community

Join our Discord to connect with thousands of developers using Continue and share your experiences. Share your feedback in GitHub discussions to let us know what you think of Mission Control.


## Configs

### Introduction to Configs

Configs are flexible containers that combine multiple components to create powerful AI coding experiences using the Continue CLI or the Extensions. A single config can include:

- **Models**: Large Language Models for chat, autocomplete, editing, and more
- **MCPs**: Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities
- **Rules**: Guidelines that shape AI behavior and responses
- **Prompts**: Reusable instructions for common coding tasks

### How Configs Work

Think of configs as recipes for AI assistance. Each config defines:
- What models to use for different tasks (chat, autocomplete, code editing)
- Which tools are available through MCP servers
- How the AI behaves through rules and guidelines
- Pre-built prompts for common workflows

This flexibility lets you create specialized setups for different contexts, like a Next.js config with React-specific rules and tools, or a data science config with Python analysis capabilities.

### Config Permissions

When creating configs, you can set visibility levels:
- **Personal**: Only you can see and use the config
- **Public**: Anyone can discover and use your config
- **Organization**: Members of your organization can access the config

### Working with Configs

You can interact with configs in three main ways:
- **Create**: Build a new config from scratch or start with a template
- **Edit**: Modify your existing configs by adding/removing components
- **Remix**: Take someone else's config and customize it for your needs

### Getting Started with Configs

1. Explore existing configs - Browse the Continue Mission Control to see what configs others have built
2. Add a config to your account - Click "Install Config" (+) on any config that interests you
3. Customize as needed - Add your API keys and customize components to match your workflow
4. Use in your IDE - Select the config from the dropdown in your Continue extension, type `/config` in the CLI, or use `--config` with the CLI commands

All configs follow the `config.yaml` format, whether you're using Mission Control interface or editing files locally.


### How to Create a Config

To create a config from scratch, select "New config" in the top bar. Choose a name, slug, description, and icon for your config.

The easiest way to create a config is to click "Create config" with the default configuration and then add/remove blocks using the sidebar. Alternatively, you can edit the config YAML directly before clicking "Create config".

You can also create a config by remixing an existing one. By clicking the "remix" button, you'll be taken to the "Create a remix" page where you can add or remove components from the config and change the name, description, icon, etc.

### How to Edit a Config

First, select a config either from Mission Control search or one that you've installed. While editing a config, you can explore Mission Control and click "+" to add it to your config.

For tools or models that require secret values like API keys, you will see a small notification on its tile that will indicate if action is needed. To delete part of your config, you can remove it from the yaml.

If a rule, prompt, or tool you want to use does not exist yet, you can create it. When you are done editing, click "Publish" to publish a new version of the config. Reload your terminal or IDE to use the latest version of the config in your agents.

### How to Use a Custom Config

Once you've found the configuration you want to use on Continue Mission Control:

1. Click "Add Config" on its page
2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)

After saving, open the Continue CLI or IDE extension and:
- Select the configuration from the config dropdown in the Continue extension
- Type `/config` and select the configuration in the Continue CLI
- Begin using it for chat mode, agent mode, or other configured capabilities


## Governance

### Creating an Organization

To Create an Organization, click the organization selector in the top right and select the option to create a new org.

1. Choose a name, which will be used as the display name for your organization throughout Mission Control
2. Add a slug, which will be used for your org URL and as the prefix to all organization configuration slugs
3. Select an icon for your organization using the image uploader
4. Finally, add a Biography, which will be displayed on your org Home Page

You will then be signed in to your org and taken to the org home page.

### Organization Permissions

Users can have the following roles within an organization:

1. **Admins** are users who can manage members, secrets, blocks, configs, etc.
2. **Members** are users who can use configs, blocks, secrets, etc.

User permissions for each role depend on the pricing plan: Solo, Teams, or Enterprise.

### Pricing

**Solo** is best suited for individuals and small teams with "single-player" problems. You can read more about what Solo includes at hub.continue.dev/pricing.

**Teams** is best suited for growing teams with "multiplayer" problems. You can read more about what Teams includes at hub.continue.dev/pricing.

**Enterprise** is best suited for large teams with enterprise-grade requirements. You can read more about what Enterprise includes at hub.continue.dev/pricing.

**Models Add-On**: The Models Add-On allows you to use a variety of frontier models for a flat monthly fee. It's designed to cover the usage of most developers. You can read more about usage limits and what models are included at hub.continue.dev/pricing.

To try out Continue, we offer a free trial of the Models Add-On that allows you to use 50 Chat requests and 2,000 autocomplete requests.


## Integrations

Integrations let Continue connect to the tools you already use, so Agents can read code, open pull requests, send messages, react to real-world events, and more.

Mission Control currently supports four first-class integrations:

### GitHub Integration

Connect your GitHub account to Continue Mission Control to enable agents to interact with your repositories. Once connected, agents can read code, create pull requests, manage issues, and automate your development workflow.

**What You Can Do with GitHub Integration:**
- Automatically create pull requests from agent tasks
- Read and analyze repository code and issues
- Manage project workflows and milestones
- Automate code reviews and quality checks
- Generate release notes and documentation

#### Setup

1. Navigate to Integrations Settings at hub.continue.dev/integrations
2. Click "Connect" next to GitHub and authorize the Continue app in your GitHub account
3. Select Repository Access - Choose whether to grant access to all repositories or select specific ones
4. Confirm Permissions - Review and approve the requested permissions

#### Use Cases

**Automated Issue Resolution**: Create agents that automatically fix bugs and open PRs
**Pull Request Management**: Automate code reviews and PR maintenance
**Documentation Generation**: Keep your docs up-to-date automatically
**Project Management**: Automate issue triage and project organization
**Release Management**: Automate your release process
**Code Quality Monitoring**: Maintain code standards across your codebase

#### Running GitHub Agents

You can run GitHub-connected agents in two ways:

1. **Manual Tasks**: Trigger agents on-demand for specific tasks in Mission Control
2. **Automated Workflows**: Set up agents to run automatically (Scheduled, Triggered, or Webhook)

Start with manual tasks to test your agent's behavior, then convert successful workflows to automations once you're confident in the results.


### Sentry Integration

Connect Sentry to Continue Mission Control to enable agents to automatically detect, analyze, and resolve production errors. When Sentry is enabled, Continue can generate PRs to fix issues, analyze error patterns, and maintain application health.

**What You Can Do with Sentry Integration:**
- Automatically generate PRs to resolve new errors
- Analyze error patterns and identify root causes
- Prioritize issues based on impact and frequency
- Create detailed bug reports with stack traces
- Monitor error trends across releases

#### Setup

1. Navigate to Integrations Settings at hub.continue.dev/integrations
2. Click "Connect" and select Sentry. You'll need:
   - Sentry Organization Slug: Your organization name (e.g., "my-company")
   - Auth Token: Internal integration token from Sentry
   - Client Secret: For webhook signature verification
3. Configure Sentry Internal Integration:
   - Create a new internal integration in Sentry
   - Set the webhook URL to `https://api.continue.dev/webhooks/sentry`
   - Select "Read and Write" access for "Issue and Event"
   - Select "issue" in the webhooks section and click Save Changes
   - Copy the Auth Token and Client Secret
4. Add Credentials to Mission Control

#### Running Sentry Agents

1. **Manual Tasks**: Trigger agents on-demand for error analysis (e.g., "Analyze the top 10 errors from the last 24 hours")
2. **Automated Workflows**: Set up agents to run automatically (Webhook-triggered, Scheduled, or Threshold-based)

Start with manual tasks to refine your prompts, then convert successful workflows to automations for continuous error monitoring.

#### Integration with GitHub

Combine Sentry with GitHub integration for a complete workflow:
1. Connect both Sentry and GitHub integrations in Mission Control
2. Create a Unified Agent that receives Sentry error notifications, analyzes the error, creates a PR with a fix, and adds the PR link to the Sentry issue
3. Set Up Automated Workflow to run automatically on new Sentry issues

#### Troubleshooting

- **Webhooks not triggering**: Verify webhook URL, check "issue" is selected, ensure Client Secret matches
- **Agent can't access Sentry data**: Verify Auth Token has correct permissions, check organization slug, ensure token hasn't expired
- **PRs not linking to Sentry issues**: Ensure both integrations are connected, verify permissions, check agent prompt includes linking instructions


### Slack Agent Integration

Mention @Continue in any channel with a task description, and it will create a new development agent, clone and work on your Repository, generate code changes and create pull requests, and keep you updated on progress.

**What It's Great For:**
- Quick bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Automated development tasks

#### Setup

Continue's Slack Bot can be installed to a Slack workspace via Mission Control, from Integrations Settings at hub.continue.dev/integrations or Org Integrations Settings.

**Note**: Continue's Slack app is in Beta development. During installation, you will see a warning that it is not yet approved/official.

Steps:
1. Connect GitHub: Click "Connect" next to GitHub in the Integrations settings, and grant access to the repositories you want Continue to work with
2. Authorize Slack: Click the "Connect" button next to Slack and authorize the app in your workspace
3. Set Default Repository (Optional): Use the repository selector within the Slack tile to select a default repository

#### Usage

To kick off an agent, mention `@Continue` with a short task description.

**Thread Context**: When you mention `@Continue` in a Slack thread, Continue automatically uses the entire conversation as context. If you start a new message (not a reply), Continue only sees that single message for context.

Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:
- ✅ Good: `@Continue Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`
- ❌ Poor: `@Continue fix auth`

**Repository Selection**: Continue determines which repository to work in with the following precedence:
1. Specify in message: Add `repo=repo-name` to your message
2. Default repo: Uses the default repository if set in the integration settings
3. Interactive selection: If no repository is found, Continue will follow up with a dropdown

**Sending Follow-up Messages**: Once an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread. Continue will forward your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one.

#### Monitoring Agent Progress

Click the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in Mission Control. You can also click the Slack icon in the agents page to return to the Slack message.

#### Disconnecting

To remove the Slack integration:
1. Go to hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations
2. Find your Slack integration
3. Click "Disconnect"

The Slack integration is in active development. Report issues on GitHub Issues and share feature requests in GitHub Discussions.


### Snyk Integration

Connect Snyk to Continue Mission Control to enable agents to automatically detect, analyze, and resolve security vulnerabilities. When Snyk is enabled, Continue can generate PRs to fix vulnerabilities, analyze security patterns, and maintain application security posture.

**What You Can Do with Snyk Integration:**
- Automatically generate PRs to fix security vulnerabilities
- Analyze dependency risks and suggest updates
- Monitor security posture across projects
- Create detailed vulnerability reports with remediation steps
- Track vulnerability trends and compliance status

#### Setup

1. Navigate to Integrations Settings at hub.continue.dev/integrations
2. Click "Connect" next to Snyk integration
3. Authorize with Snyk: Click the "Connect with Snyk" button to authorize Continue Mission Control
   - You'll be redirected to Snyk's OAuth authorization page
   - Review and approve the requested permissions
   - You'll be automatically redirected back to the Snyk inbox view
4. Verify Connection: Once redirected back, you'll see a confirmation that Snyk is connected, your Snyk projects available for monitoring, and any active vulnerability alerts

**OAuth Authorization**: No manual token configuration needed! Simply click the authorization button and Continue will securely handle the authentication flow with Snyk.

#### Integration with GitHub

Combine Snyk with GitHub integration for a complete security workflow:

1. Connect Both Integrations: Enable both Snyk and GitHub integrations in Mission Control
2. Create a Security Agent: Build an agent that receives Snyk vulnerability alerts, analyzes the security issue, creates a PR with the security fix, and adds security impact analysis to the PR
3. Set Up Automated Security Workflow: Configure the agent to run automatically on new critical vulnerabilities

#### Monitoring Agent Activity

Track your agent's security remediation performance:
1. View in Inbox: Navigate to the Snyk view to see all Snyk-related agent activity
2. Check Snyk Dashboard: Verify that vulnerabilities are being addressed
3. Review PRs: Ensure quality and security of generated fixes
4. Monitor Metrics: Track mean time to remediation (MTTR) and fix rate

#### Troubleshooting

- **OAuth authorization fails**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions in your Snyk organization, check if your organization allows OAuth integrations, try logging out and back into Snyk before authorizing
- **Projects not appearing**: Verify you have access to projects in Snyk, check that projects are properly imported, refresh the integration connection
- **Agent can't access vulnerability data**: Verify the OAuth connection is still valid, re-authorize if the token has expired, check that the agent has the necessary Snyk context provider
- **Webhooks not triggering**: Verify webhook configuration, check webhook URL points to Continue Mission Control, ensure webhook events include vulnerability detection

# Continue CLI (cn)

## Overview

Continue CLI (`cn`) is a command-line interface for automated coding tasks, scripting, and headless development workflows with Continue's AI coding capabilities.

**Continue enables developers to ship faster with Continuous AI.**

Build features from descriptions. Debug and fix issues. Navigate any codebase. Automate tedious tasks.

### Get started in 30 seconds

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18 or newer
- A Continue Mission Control account (recommended) or local configuration

```bash
# Install Continue CLI
npm install -g @continuedev/cli

# Navigate to your project
cd your-awesome-project

# Start coding with Continue
cn

# You'll be prompted to set up on first use
```

That's it! You're ready to start automating with Continue CLI.

## Two Ways to Use Continue CLI

Continue CLI offers two distinct modes designed for different workflows:

### TUI Mode: Interactive Development

**Perfect for exploration, debugging, and iterating on AI workflows**

```bash
cn
> @src/components/UserProfile.js Review this component for security issues
> Generate comprehensive unit tests
> Suggest performance improvements
```

- **Interactive conversations** with your codebase
- **Iterate and refine** prompts and approaches
- **Explore and understand** complex codebases
- **Perfect for experimentation** and learning

### Headless Mode: Production Automation

**Perfect for CI/CD, automation, and reliable workflows**

```bash
cn -p "Generate a conventional commit message for staged changes"
cn -p "Review pull request changes for security vulnerabilities"
cn -p "Update documentation based on recent code changes"
```

- **Single-command execution** for automation
- **Reliable, repeatable results** for production use
- **CI/CD and pipeline integration**
- **Git hooks and automated workflows**

### Tool Permissions in TUI vs Headless Mode

Continue CLI tools have three permission levels:
- **allow**: Executes automatically without confirmation
- **ask**: Prompts for user confirmation before execution (e.g., `writeFile`, `runTerminalCommand`)
- **exclude**: Tool is not available to the AI

**In headless mode**, tools with "ask" permission are automatically excluded to prevent the AI from seeing tools it cannot call. This ensures reliable automation without user intervention.

**In TUI mode**, tools with "ask" permission are available and will prompt for confirmation when the AI attempts to use them.

**Tip**: If your workflow requires tools that need confirmation (like file writes or terminal commands), use TUI mode. For fully automated workflows with read-only operations, use headless mode.

### Development Workflow: TUI → Headless

**Pro Tip**: Start in TUI mode to iterate on your AI agent. Once you have a workflow that works reliably, deploy it as a Continuous AI automation.

1. **Experiment in TUI mode** to perfect your agent
2. **Test different approaches** interactively until you get consistent results
3. **Convert successful workflows** to automated Continuous AI commands
4. **Deploy in production** with confidence in your proven approach

```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
- Ask for help in our discussions at github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions
- Report bugs on GitHub at github.com/continuedev/continue


## Continue CLI Quick Start

Get hands-on experience with Continue CLI through practical development workflows.

**TUI Mode** (`cn` command) is for **large development tasks** that require agentic workflows with human oversight. Perfect for complex refactors, feature implementation, or one-off automation tasks that need monitoring and iteration.

**Headless Mode** (`-p` flag) is for **reliable, repeatable tasks** that no longer need constant supervision. Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, git hooks, and automated workflows you've already tested and refined.

### TUI Mode: Large Development Tasks

Make sure you have Continue CLI installed and are in a project directory.

#### Example: Implementing a New Feature

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-awesome-project

# Start TUI Mode for complex development work
cn
```

**Example workflow for adding authentication:**

```
> I need to add JWT authentication to this Express app. Let me start by showing you the current structure.

> @src/app.js @package.json Here's my current setup. Can you implement JWT auth with middleware, login/register routes, and user model?

> [Agent analyzes codebase and implements auth system]
> [You review changes, test, and provide feedback]
> [Agent iterates based on your input until the feature is complete]
```

#### Example: Complex Refactoring

```bash
cn
```

**Refactoring a monolithic component:**

```
> @src/components/Dashboard.jsx This component is 800 lines and does too much. Help me break it into smaller, reusable components.

> [Agent analyzes component structure]
> [Proposes component breakdown strategy]
> [You approve approach]
> [Agent implements the refactor with proper props and state management]
> [You test and request adjustments]
```

#### When to Use TUI Mode

✅ **Large development tasks** that need oversight  
✅ **Complex refactors** requiring multiple steps  
✅ **New feature implementation** with unknowns  
✅ **One-off automation tasks** you haven't done before  
✅ **Debugging complex issues** that need exploration

### Headless Mode: Automated Workflows

Once you've refined a workflow in TUI Mode, convert it to Continuous AI for automation.

#### Example: From TUI → Continuous AI

**Step 1: Develop in TUI Mode**

```bash
cn
> @package.json @CHANGELOG.md Generate release notes for version 2.1.0
> [Test and refine the prompt until it works perfectly]
```

**Step 2: Convert to Continuous AI**

```bash
# Now use the refined workflow in automation
cn -p "Generate release notes for the current version based on package.json and recent commits"
```

#### Common Continuous AI Workflows

```bash
# Git automation
cn -p "Generate a conventional commit message for staged changes"
cn -p "Review the last 3 commits for potential issues"

# Code quality
cn -p "Fix all TypeScript errors in the src/ directory"
cn -p "Update outdated dependencies and fix breaking changes"

# Documentation
cn -p "@README.md Update documentation based on recent changes"
cn -p "Generate API documentation from JSDoc comments"

# CI/CD integration
cn -p "Analyze test failures and create GitHub issue with findings"
cn -p "Update version numbers and create release branch"
```

#### When to Use Headless Mode

✅ **Proven workflows** you've tested in TUI Mode  
✅ **Repetitive tasks** that no longer need oversight  
✅ **CI/CD automation** in pipelines  
✅ **Git hooks** for automated checks  
✅ **Scheduled tasks** that run unattended

**Tool Permission Differences Between Modes**

Tools requiring user confirmation ("ask" permission) like `writeFile` and `runTerminalCommand` are:
- **Available in TUI mode** - AI can use them with your approval
- **Excluded in headless mode** - AI cannot see or call them

This prevents the AI from attempting operations that require user interaction when running in automated environments. Choose TUI mode if your workflow needs tools that modify files or run commands.


### Available Slash Commands

### The Development Workflow

**Recommended Approach**: Start complex tasks in TUI Mode to iterate and refine your approach. Once you have a reliable workflow, convert it to Headless Mode for automation.

#### Workflow Pattern

1. **🔬 Experiment in TUI Mode**
   - Try complex development tasks with human oversight
   - Iterate on prompts and approaches until they work reliably
   - Test edge cases and refine the agent's behavior

2. **⚡ Automate with Continuous AI**
   - Convert proven TUI workflows to single commands
   - Deploy in CI/CD, git hooks, or scheduled tasks
   - Run with confidence knowing the approach is tested
