title: "File Access Outside Workspace"
description: "Learn how Continue's Agent and Plan modes handle file access outside the IDE workspace, including permission requirements and supported path formats."
---

## Overview

Continue's Agent and Plan modes can read files and list directories both within and outside your IDE workspace. For security, accessing files outside the workspace requires explicit user permission.

## How File Access Works

When you use tools like `read_file`, `ls`, `view_subdirectory`, or `read_file_range`, Continue:

1. **Resolves the path** - Normalizes the provided path (relative, absolute, tilde, or file:// URI)
2. **Checks workspace boundaries** - Determines if the path is within or outside your workspace
3. **Applies access policy** - Files within workspace are read automatically; files outside require permission

## Supported Path Formats

Continue supports multiple path formats for flexible file access:

### Relative Paths

Paths relative to your workspace root:

```
src/components/Button.tsx
../shared-utils/helpers.js
```

These are always resolved within the workspace and don't require permission.

### Absolute Paths

Full system paths:

```
/home/user/documents/notes.txt
C:\Users\username\Desktop\config.json
```

### Tilde Paths

Home directory expansion:

```
~/Documents/project-notes.md
~/.ssh/config
```

The `~` expands to your home directory (e.g., `/home/user` or `C:\Users\username`).

### File URIs

File protocol URIs:

```
file:///home/user/documents/notes.txt
file:///C:/Users/username/Desktop/config.json
```

These are automatically decoded and resolved to system paths.

### Windows Network Paths

UNC paths for network shares:

```
\\server\share\folder\file.txt
```

## Workspace Boundary Detection

Continue determines workspace boundaries by checking if a resolved path starts with any of your IDE's workspace directories. This applies to:

- Single-folder workspaces
- Multi-root workspaces (e.g., VS Code multi-root)
- Monorepo setups with multiple workspace directories

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Reading within workspace**

```
Workspace: /home/user/myproject
Request: read_file("src/main.ts")
Result: ✅ Allowed automatically (within workspace)
```

**Scenario 2: Reading outside workspace**

```
Workspace: /home/user/myproject
Request: read_file("~/Documents/external-notes.md")
Result: ⚠️ Requires user permission (outside workspace)
```

**Scenario 3: Reading with absolute path**

```
Workspace: /home/user/myproject
Request: read_file("/etc/hosts")
Result: ⚠️ Requires user permission (outside workspace)
```

## Security and Permissions

### Permission Policy

- **Within workspace**: Files are accessible without permission (policy: `allowedWithoutPermission`)
- **Outside workspace**: Files require explicit user permission (policy: `allowedWithPermission`)
- **Disabled tools**: Respects tool policy settings if explicitly disabled

### User Experience

When Agent or Plan mode attempts to access a file outside the workspace:

1. The tool call is displayed with the full path
2. A permission prompt appears asking for confirmation
3. You can approve or deny the access
4. Future accesses may still require permission depending on your settings

### Best Practices

<Warning>
  Be cautious when granting permission to access files outside your workspace. Verify the path and ensure you trust the operation being performed.
</Warning>

- **Review paths carefully** - Check that file paths in permission prompts are expected
- **Understand the context** - Know why the agent is requesting external file access
- **Limit scope** - Consider moving frequently accessed external files into your workspace
- **Use tool policies** - Configure tool policies in your settings to control access patterns

## Available Tools with External Access

The following tools support reading files outside the workspace:

### Read-Only Tools (Plan & Agent Mode)

- **read_file** - Read complete file contents
- **read_file_range** - Read specific line ranges from a file
- **ls** - List files and directories
- **view_subdirectory** - View directory structure

### Path Resolution

All these tools use the same path resolution logic:

1. Parse the input path (relative, absolute, tilde, URI)
2. Resolve to an absolute system path
3. Check workspace boundaries
4. Apply appropriate permission policy

## Examples

### Reading Configuration Files

```
# Agent prompt
"Read my SSH config file at ~/.ssh/config and summarize the hosts"

# Continue resolves ~/. ssh/config to /home/user/.ssh/config
# Prompts for permission since it's outside workspace
# Reads and provides summary
```

### Listing External Directories

```
# Agent prompt
"List all markdown files in ~/Documents/notes"

# Continue resolves ~/Documents/notes
# Prompts for permission
# Lists .md files in that directory
```

### Comparing Files Across Locations

```
# Agent prompt
"Compare src/config.json with /etc/app/default-config.json"

# src/config.json - within workspace, reads immediately
# /etc/app/default-config.json - outside workspace, prompts for permission
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors

If you see permission denied errors:

1. **Check file system permissions** - Ensure your user account can read the file
2. **Verify path resolution** - Confirm the path resolves correctly for your OS
3. **Review tool policies** - Check if the tool is disabled in settings

### Path Not Found

If paths aren't resolving:

1. **Use absolute paths** - Try providing full system paths
2. **Check tilde expansion** - Verify `~` expands to the correct home directory
3. **Escape special characters** - Quote paths with spaces or special characters
4. **Windows paths** - Use forward slashes or properly escaped backslashes

### Unexpected Permission Prompts

If you're prompted for files you expect to be in the workspace:

1. **Verify workspace configuration** - Check your IDE's workspace settings
2. **Check symbolic links** - Symlinks may resolve outside workspace boundaries
3. **Review path normalization** - Ensure paths are being resolved correctly
