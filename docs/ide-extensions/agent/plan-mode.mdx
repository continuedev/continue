## What is Plan mode?

Plan mode is a restricted environment that provides read-only access to your codebase. It's designed for safe exploration, understanding code, and planning changes without making any modifications.

### What Are the Key Features of Plan Mode?

- **Read-only tools**: Access files, search, and analyze without risk
- **Safe exploration**: Perfect for understanding unfamiliar codebases
- **Planning focus**: Develop implementation strategies before execution
- **MCP support**: Works with all MCP tools alongside built-in read-only tools

### How Plan Mode Works

Plan mode filters the available tools to only include read-only operations. This means you can:

- Read any file in your project
- Search through code with grep and glob patterns
- View repository structure and diffs
- Fetch web content for additional context
- Use all MCP tools

But you cannot:

- Create, edit, or delete files
- Run terminal commands
- Make any system changes

### How to Get Started with Plan Mode

Select "Plan" from the mode selector below the chat input, or use `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to cycle through modes.

For detailed information about tools and usage, see the [Agent documentation](/ide-extensions/agent/how-it-works), which covers both Agent and Plan modes.

### What Is the Common Workflow for Plan Mode?

1. **Start in Plan mode** to explore and understand
2. **Develop your approach** with the model's help
3. **Switch to Agent mode** when ready to implement

<Tip>
  Plan mode shares the same interface and context features as Chat and Agent
  modes. You can use `@` context providers and highlight code just like in other
  modes.
