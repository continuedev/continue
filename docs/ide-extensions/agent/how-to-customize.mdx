## How to Add Rules Blocks

Adding Rules can be done in your configuration locally or in Mission Control. You can explore Rules on the Continue Mission Control and refer to the [Rules deep dive](/customize/deep-dives/rules) for more details.

## How to Customize System Messages

You can customize the system messages for Chat, Agent, and Plan modes using model-level configuration:

```yaml
models:
  - name: GPT-4o
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    chatOptions:
      baseSystemMessage: "You are a helpful coding agent."
      baseAgentSystemMessage: "You are a systematic coding agent. Break down problems methodically."
      basePlanSystemMessage: "You are a planning agent. Create clear, actionable steps."
```

## How to Add MCP Tools

You can add MCP servers to your configuration to give Agent mode access to more tools. Explore [MCP Servers on Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=mcpServers) and consult the [MCP guide](/customize/deep-dives/mcp) for more details.

## How to Configure Tool Policies

You can adjust the Agent mode's tool usage behavior to three options:

- **Ask First (default)**: Request user permission with "Cancel" and "Continue" buttons
- **Automatic**: Automatically call the tool without requesting permission
- **Excluded**: Do not send the tool to the model

:::warning
Be careful setting tools to "automatic" if their behavior is not read-only.
:::

To manage tool policies:

1. Click the tools icon in the input toolbar
2. View and change policies by clicking on the policy text
3. You can also toggle groups of tools on/off

Tool policies are stored locally per user.
