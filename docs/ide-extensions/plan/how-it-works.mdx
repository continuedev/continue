## Understanding Plan Mode

Plan mode is designed to help you understand code and construct plans before making changes. It sits between Chat mode (no tools) and Agent mode (all tools), providing a middle ground where you can explore and analyze without risk.

### The Key Difference: Read-Only Tools

While Agent mode has access to all tools including those that modify files, Plan mode restricts access to only read-only tools. This ensures that:

- No files are created, modified, or deleted
- No commands are executed that could change system state
- All exploration is safe and non-destructive
- You can confidently investigate without unintended consequences

## How Plan Mode Works

When you select Plan mode:

1. Continue sends a special system message instructing the model to focus on understanding and planning
2. The tool list is filtered to include only read-only tools
3. The model can use these tools to explore and analyze your codebase
4. When you're ready to implement changes, you switch to Agent mode

### Available Tools in Plan Mode

Plan mode includes these read-only built-in tools:

- **Read file** (`read_file`): Read the contents of any file in the project
- **Read currently open file** (`read_currently_open_file`): Read the contents of the currently open file
- **List directory** (`ls`): List files and directories
- **Glob search** (`glob_search`): Search for files matching a pattern
- **Grep search** (`grep_search`): Search file contents using regex patterns
- **Fetch URL content** (`fetch_url_content`): Retrieve content from web URLs
- **Search web** (`search_web`): Perform web searches for additional context
- **View diff** (`view_diff`): View the current git diff
- **View repo map** (`view_repo_map`): Get an overview of the repository structure
- **View subdirectory** (`view_subdirectory`): Get a detailed view of a specific directory
- **Codebase tool** (`codebase_tool`): Advanced codebase analysis capabilities

### MCP Tools Support

In addition to built-in read-only tools, Plan mode also supports all MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. This allows integration with external services that provide additional context or analysis capabilities without modifying your local environment.

<Info>
  While Plan mode restricts built-in tools to read-only operations, MCP tools
  are not filtered by Continue. Some MCP tools may have write capabilities that
  could modify your system or external services. Always verify what actions your
  MCP tools can perform before using them in Plan mode.

## The Planning Workflow

A typical Plan mode workflow follows these steps:

1. **Exploration**: Use read-only tools to understand the current state
2. **Analysis**: Identify what needs to change and potential impacts
3. **Planning**: Develop a detailed plan for implementation
4. **Verification**: Review the plan and ensure it addresses all requirements
5. **Execution**: Switch to Agent mode to implement the plan

### Example: Planning a Refactor

```
User: Help me plan a refactor to extract the authentication logic into a separate module

Plan mode:
1. Reads relevant files to understand current structure
2. Analyzes dependencies and usage patterns
3. Identifies all places that need updates
4. Creates a step-by-step refactoring plan
5. Suggests: "Switch to Agent mode to implement this plan"
```

## System Message and Behavior

Plan mode uses a dedicated system message that:

- Instructs the model to focus on understanding and planning
- Emphasizes using only read-only tools
- Reminds the model to suggest switching to Agent mode for implementation
- Encourages thorough analysis before suggesting changes

<Info>
  The system message can be customized per model. See it [directly in
  the
  code](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/defaultSystemMessages.ts).

## When to Use Plan Mode vs Other Modes

### Use Plan Mode When:

- Exploring unfamiliar codebases
- Planning complex refactors or features
- Debugging and understanding issues
- Reviewing code architecture
- Creating implementation strategies

### Use Chat Mode When:

- Having discussions without needing file access
- Asking general programming questions
- Getting explanations without exploring code

### Use Agent Mode When:

- Ready to implement changes
- Need to create or modify files
- Want to run commands or tests
- Implementing a plan developed in Plan mode
