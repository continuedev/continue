## How to Customize Chat

There are a number of different ways to customize Chat:

- Add [rules](/customize/rules) to give the model persistent instructions through the system prompt
- Create [prompts](/customize/prompts) to kickoff workflows with instructions you repeat often

## Token Usage Display

You can control where token usage is shown in the UI with the VS Code setting:

```json
"continue.showTokenUsage": "never" | "history" | "session" | "turn"
```

- `never`: Hide token usage in Chat and History.
- `history`: Show token usage in History only.
- `session`: Show token usage in History and in the current session summary.
- `turn`: Show token usage in History, session summary, and each assistant turn.

Usage is always tracked and persisted in local session files.

The **Usage** page in Settings -> Help shows local analytics totals from the local usage database, so totals there can differ from visible chat history totals.
