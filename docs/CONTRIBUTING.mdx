## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
2. **Git** for version control

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/continue.git
   cd continue/docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the local development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Your docs will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üí¨ Creating Discussions and Issues

Before creating any issues, we ask that you start with a GitHub Discussion. This helps us organize feedback and determine the best path forward.

### Starting a Discussion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to GitHub Discussions">
    Visit the [Continue GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions) page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose the right category">
    Select the **Docs** category for documentation improvements, corrections, or suggestions.
   
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide detailed information">
    Include the following in your discussion:
    - Clear description of the issue or suggestion
    - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
    - Expected vs. actual behavior
    - Screenshots or code examples when helpful
    - Your environment (OS, IDE, Continue version)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Issue Escalation Process

<Info>
  
  **Important**: All issues should start as discussions. The Continue team will determine if and when a discussion should be escalated to a GitHub issue.
  
</Info>

The Continue team will review discussions and may:
- Provide a solution or clarification directly in the discussion
- Ask for additional information or testing
- Convert the discussion to an issue if it requires code changes or is a confirmed bug
- Close the discussion if it's resolved or not actionable

### When Discussions Become Issues

A discussion will typically be converted to an issue when:
- A bug in the documentation is confirmed
- A new feature or significant documentation change is approved
- Community consensus supports the proposed change
- Technical implementation is required

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Documentation with Continue

We strongly encourage using Continue's AI assistance to maintain consistency and quality in our documentation. Here are three ways to set this up:

### Option 1: Use the Pre-Built Documentation Agent (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our pre-configured documentation agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the agent from Continue Hub">
    Visit [the Docs Assistant - Mintlify in the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/docs-mintlify) and click "Install" to add it to your Continue setup. This agent comes pre-configured with all our documentation standards.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the agent">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Command Line">
        ```bash
        # Install the Continue CLI if you haven't already
        npm install -g @continuedev/cli
        
        # Use the agent from the command line
        cn "Create a new guide for using the Continue CLI with Linear" --config continuedev/docs-mintlify
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="IDE">
        1. Open Continue in your IDE
        2. Select the "Docs Assistant - Mintlify" agent from the model dropdown
        3. Ask it to help you create or edit documentation
        
        Example prompts:
        - "Create a new guide for using the Continue CLI with Linear"
        - "Update the getting-started guide with the new installation process"
        - "Format this documentation according to Mintlify standards"
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can also remix this agent to customize it for your specific needs. Learn how to create your own remix in our [remix agent documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/remixing-agents).
</Tip>

### Option 2: Create Your Own Custom Agent

If you want more control or customization, you can create your own documentation agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new agent">
    Follow our [agent creation guide](https://docs.continue.dev/hub/creating-agents) to set up your own agent.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Continue Docs MCP">
    Install from Continue Hub: https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/continue-docs-mcp
    
    This MCP provides context about Continue's documentation structure and standards.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Mintlify formatting rules">
    Install from Continue Hub: https://hub.continue.dev/mintlify/technical-writing-rule
    
    This rule ensures proper Mintlify component formatting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use your custom agent">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Command Line">
        ```bash
        # Install the Continue CLI if you haven't already
        npm install -g @continuedev/cli
        
        # Use your agent from the command line
        cn "Create a new guide for API authentication" --agent your-agent-name
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="IDE">
        1. Open Continue in your IDE
        2. Select your custom agent from the model dropdown
        3. Ask it to help you create or edit documentation
        
        Example prompts:
        - "Help me format this documentation according to Mintlify standards"
        - "Create a troubleshooting section for this feature"
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Mintlify Component Guidelines

When using Mintlify components, follow these formatting rules:

#### Cards and Info Boxes

```mdx
<Card title="Best Practice" icon="lightbulb">

Always include blank lines and proper indentation:

- Use 2-space indentation
- Add blank lines after opening tags
- Format lists as bullet points

</Card>
```

#### Warning and Note Components

```mdx
<Warning>

Important information should be formatted clearly:

- Each point on its own line
- Consistent indentation
- Clear, concise language

</Warning>
```

### Writing Style

1. **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly
2. **Use examples**: Show, don't just tell
3. **Include code blocks**: Provide working examples
4. **Add visuals**: Screenshots and diagrams help understanding
5. **Test your changes**: Ensure all links and code examples work

<Warning>
If you are creating a new guide, please test the steps yourself to ensure accuracy.
</Warning>

## üîß Common Tasks

### Adding a New Guide

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the guides directory
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Your Guide Title"
   description: "Brief description of what this guide covers"
   ---
   ```
3. Use the Continue agent to help format your content
4. Update `docs.json` to include your new page in the navigation

<Tip>
We have both guides and cookbooks. Use guides for step-by-step instructions and cookbooks for creating agents for the CLI.
</Tip>

### Updating Existing Documentation

1. Use the Continue agent with prompts like:
   - "Update the installation guide with the new npm package"
   - "Add a troubleshooting section for connection issues"
2. The agent will maintain consistent formatting automatically

### Adding Code Examples

Use language-specific code blocks:

````mdx
```typescript
// Your TypeScript code here
const example = "Hello, Continue!";
```
````

## üêõ Testing Your Changes

1. **Local preview**: In the docs directory, run `npm run dev` and check your changes
2. **Link validation**: Ensure all internal and external links work
3. **Format check**: Use the Continue agent to validate Mintlify formatting
4. **Build test**: Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors

## üì§ Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: describe your changes"
   ```

3. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin docs/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the Continue repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Use the Continue agent**: It knows our documentation standards and will save you time
- **Preview frequently**: Check your changes in the local dev server
- **Ask questions**: Open an issue or discussion if you need clarification
- **Small PRs are better**: Focus on one topic or fix per PR
- **Update examples**: Ensure code examples reflect the latest API
