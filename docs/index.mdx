title: "What is Continue?"

Your tests pass. But standards slip.

Linters catch syntax. Tests verify behavior. But nobody's checking whether that migration is safe, the API docs got updated, or the auth flow follows your team's conventions. Reviewers repeat the same feedback on every PR, and things still slip through.

**Continue runs source-controlled AI checks on every pull request.** Standards as checks, enforced by AI, decided by humans.

## Quickstart

1. Go to [continue.dev/check](https://continue.dev/check) to run checks on a pull request.

## How it works

Each check is a markdown file in your repo, version-controlled, reviewable, owned by your team. You define what to look for. The AI enforces it on every PR. Results show up as GitHub status checks: green if the code looks good, red with a suggested fix if not.

Consistency over breadth: checks only enforce what you asked for, and never miss it.

```markdown .continue/checks/security-review.md
---
name: Security Review
description: Flag hardcoded secrets and missing input validation
---

Review this pull request for security issues.

Flag as failing if any of these are true:

- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source files
- New API endpoints without input validation
- SQL queries built with string concatenation
- Sensitive data logged to stdout

If none of these issues are found, pass the check.
```

When a PR is opened, Continue runs each check against the diff and reports the result as a GitHub status check. If a check fails, it suggests a fix you can accept or reject directly from GitHub.
