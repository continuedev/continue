description: "Run agents as CI checks on every PR"
---

Continue lets you create agents that review every pull request. Each agent runs as a GitHub check — green if the code looks good, red with a suggested diff if not.

Agents are markdown prompts describing the standards you want to enforce. They can be defined at [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/agents) or in your repo at `.continue/agents/`.

For example, you could create this file

```markdown .continue/agents/security-review.md
Review this PR and check that:

- No secrets or API keys are hardcoded
- All new API endpoints have input validation
- Error responses use the standard error format
```

or you could use this agent as a starting point.

## Get started

1. Connect GitHub at [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/)
2. [Create an agent](https://continue.dev/agents/new) — write your rules in markdown, set the trigger to GitHub
3. Open a PR and watch it run
