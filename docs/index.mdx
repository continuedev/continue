Continue lets you create agents that review every pull request. Each agent runs as a GitHub check: green if the code looks good, red with a suggested diff if not.

Agents are markdown prompts describing the standards you want to enforce. They can be defined at [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/agents) or in your repo at `.continue/agents/`.

For example, you could use [this agent](https://www.continue.dev/continuedev/code-security-review) as a starting point, or you could create the following file in your repository:

```markdown .continue/agents/security-review.md
---
name: Security Review
description: Review PR for basic security vulnerabilities
---

Review this PR and check that:

- No secrets or API keys are hardcoded
- All new API endpoints have input validation
- Error responses use the standard error format
```

## Get started

1. Connect GitHub at [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/)
2. [Create an agent](https://continue.dev/agents/new)
3. Open a PR. The agent will show up as a check in GitHub.
4. If changes are suggested, click the check in GitHub and accept or reject the suggestion to make the check pass.
