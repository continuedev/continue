## Check the logs

To solve many problems, the first step is reading the logs to find the relevant error message. To do this, follow these steps:

### VS Code

#### Console logs

<Info>
  In order to view debug logs, which contain extra information, click the
  dropdown at the top that says "Default levels" and select "Verbose".
</Info>

1. `cmd` + `shift` + `P` for MacOS or `ctrl`
   - `shift` + `P` for Windows
2. Search for and then select "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools"
3. This will open the [Chrome DevTools window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
4. Select the `Console` tab
5. Read the console logs

#### Prompt Logs (Continue Console)

To view prompt logs/analytics, you can enable the Continue Console.

1. Open VS Code settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`)
2. Search for the setting "Continue: Enable Console" and enable it
3. Reload the window
4. Open the Continue Console by using the command palette (`cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `P`) and searching for "Continue: Focus on Continue Console View"

### JetBrains

Open `~/.continue/logs/core.log` to view the logs for the Continue plugin. The most recent logs are found at the bottom of the file.

Some JetBrains-related logs may also be found by clicking "Help" > "Show Log in Explorer/Finder".

## Download the latest pre-release

### VS Code

We are constantly making fixes and improvements to Continue, but the latest changes remain in a "pre-release" version for roughly a week so that we can test their stability. If you are experiencing issues, you can try the pre-release by going to the Continue extension page in VS Code and selecting "Switch to Pre-Release" as shown below.

![Pre-Release](/images/images/prerelease-9bed93e846914165d30a3b227a680d9b.png)

### JetBrains

On JetBrains, the "pre-release" happens through their Early Access Program (EAP) channel. To download the latest EAP version, enable the EAP channel:

1. Open JetBrains settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`) and go to "Plugins"
2. Click the gear icon at the top
3. Select "Manage Plugin Repositories..."
4. Add "[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list)" to the list
5. You'll now always be able to download the latest EAP version from the marketplace

## Download an Older Version

If you've tried everything, reported an error, know that a previous version was working for you, and are waiting to hear back, you can try downloading an older version of the extension.

For VS Code, All versions are hosted on the Open VSX Registry [here](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Continue/continue). Once you've downloaded the extension, which will be a .vsix file, you can install it manually by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

You can find older versions of the JetBrains extension on their [marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue), which will walk you through installing from disk.

## Keyboard shortcuts not resolving

If your keyboard shortcuts are not resolving, you may have other commands that are taking precedence over the Continue shortcuts. You can see if this is the case, and change your shortcut mappings, in the configuration of your IDE.

## FAQs

### Networking Issues

#### Configure Certificates

If you're seeing a `fetch failed` error and your network requires custom certificates, you will need to configure them in your config file. In each of the objects in the `"models"` array, add `requestOptions.caBundlePath` like this:

- YAML
- JSON

config.yaml

```
models:
  - name: My Model
    ...
    requestOptions:
      caBundlePath: /path/to/cert.pem
```

config.json

```json
{  "models": [    {      "title": "My Model",      ...      "requestOptions": {        "caBundlePath": "/path/to/cert.pem"      }    }  ],}
```

You may also set `requestOptions.caBundlePath` to an array of paths to multiple certificates.

**_Windows VS Code Users_**: Installing the [win-ca](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ukoloff.win-ca) extension should also correct this issue.

#### VS Code Proxy Settings

If you are using VS Code and require requests to be made through a proxy, you are likely already set up through VS Code's [Proxy Server Support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network#_proxy-server-support). To double-check that this is enabled, use `cmd/ctrl` + `,` to open settings and search for "Proxy Support". Unless it is set to "off", then VS Code is responsible for making the request to the proxy.

#### code-server

Continue can be used in [code-server](https://coder.com/), but if you are running across an error in the logs that includes "This is likely because the editor is not running in a secure context", please see [their documentation on securely exposing code-server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/guide#expose-code-server).

### I installed Continue, but don't see the sidebar window

By default the Continue window is on the left side of VS Code, but it can be dragged to right side as well, which we recommend in our tutorial. In the situation where you have previously installed Continue and moved it to the right side, it may still be there. You can reveal Continue either by using cmd/ctrl+L or by clicking the button in the top right of VS Code to open the right sidebar.

### I'm getting a 404 error from OpenAI

If you have entered a valid API key and model, but are still getting a 404 error from OpenAI, this may be because you need to add credits to your billing account. You can do so from the [billing console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview). If you just want to check that this is in fact the cause of the error, you can try adding $1 to your account and checking whether the error persists.

### I'm getting a 404 error from OpenRouter

If you have entered a valid API key and model, but are still getting a 404 error from OpenRouter, this may be because models that do not support function calling will return an error to Continue when a request is sent. Example error: `HTTP 404 Not Found from https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`

### Indexing issues

If you are having persistent errors with indexing, our recommendation is to rebuild your index from scratch. Note that for large codebases this may take some time.

This can be accomplished using the following command: `Continue: Rebuild codebase index`.

### Agent mode is unavailable or tools aren't working

If Agent mode is grayed out or tools aren't functioning properly, this is likely due to model capability configuration issues.

<Info>
  Continue uses system message tools as a fallback for models without native tool support, so most models should work with Agent mode automatically.
</Info>

#### Check if your model has tool support

1. Not all models support native tool/function calling, but Continue will automatically use system message tools as a fallback
2. Try adding `capabilities: ["tool_use"]` to your model config to force tool support
3. Verify your provider supports function calling or that system message tools are working correctly

#### Tools Not Working

If tools aren't being called:

1. Ensure `tool_use` is in your capabilities
2. Check that your API endpoint actually supports function calling
3. Some providers may use different function calling formats

#### Images Not Uploading

If you can't upload images:

1. Add `image_input` to capabilities
2. Ensure your model actually supports vision (e.g., gpt-4-vision, claude-3)
3. Check that your provider passes through image data

#### Add capabilities

If Continue's autodetection isn't working correctly, you can manually add capabilities in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my-model
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

#### Verify with provider

Some proxy services (like OpenRouter) or custom deployments may not preserve tool calling capabilities. Check your provider's documentation.

#### Verifying Current Capabilities

To see what capabilities Continue detected for your model:

1. Check the mode selector tooltips - they indicate if tools are available
2. Try uploading an image - if disabled, the model lacks `image_input`
3. Check if Agent mode is available - requires `tool_use`

See the [Model Capabilities guide](/customize/deep-dives/model-capabilities) for complete configuration details.

### Android Studio - "Nothing to show" in Chat

This can be fixed by selecting `Actions > Choose Boot runtime for the IDE` then selecting the latest version, and then restarting Android Studio. [See this thread](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/596#issuecomment-1789327178) for details.

### I received a "Codebase indexing disabled - Your Linux system lacks required CPU features (AVX2, FMA)" notification

We use LanceDB as our vector database for codebase search features. On x64 Linux systems, LanceDB requires specific CPU features (FMA and AVX2) which may not be available on older processors.

Most Continue features will work normally, including autocomplete and chat. However, commands that rely on codebase indexing, such as `@codebase`, `@files`, and `@folder`, will be disabled.

For more details about this requirement, see the [LanceDB issue #2195](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/issues/2195).

### How do I reset the state of the extension?

Continue stores it's data in the `~/.continue` directory (%USERPROFILE%.continue\` on Windows).

If you'd like to perform a clean reset of the extension, including removing all configuration files, indices, etc, you can remove this directory, uninstall, and then reinstall.
