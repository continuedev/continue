## Check the logs

To solve many problems, the first step is reading the logs to find the relevant error message. To do this, follow these steps:

### VS Code

#### Console logs

<Info>
  In order to view debug logs, which contain extra information, click the
  dropdown at the top that says "Default levels" and select "Verbose".
</Info>

1. `cmd` + `shift` + `P` for MacOS or `ctrl`
   - `shift` + `P` for Windows
2. Search for and then select "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools"
3. This will open the [Chrome DevTools window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
4. Select the `Console` tab
5. Read the console logs

#### Prompt Logs (Continue Console)

To view prompt logs/analytics, you can enable the Continue Console.

1. Open VS Code settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`)
2. Search for the setting "Continue: Enable Console" and enable it
3. Reload the window
4. Open the Continue Console by using the command palette (`cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `P`) and searching for "Continue: Focus on Continue Console View"

### JetBrains

Open `~/.continue/logs/core.log` to view the logs for the Continue plugin. The most recent logs are found at the bottom of the file.

Some JetBrains-related logs may also be found by clicking "Help" > "Show Log in Explorer/Finder".

## Download the latest pre-release

### VS Code

We are constantly making fixes and improvements to Continue, but the latest changes remain in a "pre-release" version for roughly a week so that we can test their stability. If you are experiencing issues, you can try the pre-release by going to the Continue extension page in VS Code and selecting "Switch to Pre-Release" as shown below.

### JetBrains

On JetBrains, the "pre-release" happens through their Early Access Program (EAP) channel. To download the latest EAP version, enable the EAP channel:

1. Open JetBrains settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`) and go to "Plugins"
2. Click the gear icon at the top
3. Select "Manage Plugin Repositories..."
4. Add "[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list)" to the list
5. You'll now always be able to download the latest EAP version from the marketplace

## Download an Older Version

If you've tried everything, reported an error, know that a previous version was working for you, and are waiting to hear back, you can try downloading an older version of the extension.

For VS Code, All versions are hosted on the Open VSX Registry [here](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Continue/continue). Once you've downloaded the extension, which will be a .vsix file, you can install it manually by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

You can find older versions of the JetBrains extension on their [marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue), which will walk you through installing from disk.

## Keyboard shortcuts not resolving

If your keyboard shortcuts are not resolving, you may have other commands that are taking precedence over the Continue shortcuts. You can see if this is the case, and change your shortcut mappings, in the configuration of your IDE.
