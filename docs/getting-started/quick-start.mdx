## üîÑ Autocomplete

**What it does**: Provides intelligent inline code suggestions as you type, powered by AI.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Test File">
Create a new file called `tutorial.js` (or use any language you prefer) in your IDE
</Step>

<Step title="Try Autocomplete">
Copy this starter code and place your cursor at the end of the comment:

```javascript
// TODO: Implement a sorting algorithm function
function sortingAlgorithm(arr) {
  // Place cursor here and press Enter
}
```

Press **Enter** and watch Continue suggest code completions. Press **Tab** to accept suggestions.

</Step>

<Step title="See the Magic">
Continue will intelligently suggest function implementations based on the context and comment.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Autocomplete works best when you provide clear function names, comments, or
  type annotations that give context about your intent.
</Tip>

## ‚úèÔ∏è Edit

**What it does**: Make quick, targeted changes to specific code sections using natural language instructions.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Sample Code">
Paste this bubble sort implementation in your file:

```javascript
function sortingAlgorithm(x) {
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < x.length - 1; j++) {
      if (x[j] > x[j + 1]) {
        let temp = x[j];
        x[j] = x[j + 1];
        x[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return x;
}
```

</Step><Step title="Highlight the Function">
**Highlight** the entire function in your editor
</Step>

<Step title="Open Edit Mode">Press **Cmd/Ctrl + I** to open Edit mode</Step>

<Step title="Give Instructions">
  Type: `"make this more readable and add TypeScript types"`
</Step>

<Step title="Watch the Magic">
  Watch Continue refactor your code automatically!
</Step>

<Step title="Review Changes">
Continue will show you a diff of the proposed changes. Accept or reject individual changes as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Edit is perfect for refactoring, adding documentation, fixing bugs, or
  converting between languages/frameworks.
</Note>

## üí¨ Chat

**What it does**: Interactive AI assistant that can analyze code, answer questions, and provide guidance without leaving your IDE.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Another Function">
Add this second sorting function to your file:

```javascript
function sortingAlgorithm2(x) {
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < x.length - 1; j++) {
      if (x[j] > x[j + 1]) {
        let temp = x[j];
        x[j] = x[j + 1];
        x[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return x;
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start a Conversation">
1. **Highlight** the function 
2. Use the keyboard shortcuts below to add it to Chat.
3. Ask: `"What sorting algorithm is this and how can I optimize it?"`
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Further">
Try these follow-up questions:
- `"Show me how to implement quicksort instead"`
- `"What's the time complexity of this algorithm?"`
- `"Can you write unit tests for this function?"`
</Step>
</Steps>

## ü§ñ Agent

**What it does**: An autonomous coding assistant that can read files, make changes, run commands, and handle complex multi-step tasks.

<Steps>
<Step title="Switch to Agent Mode">
1. Open the Continue panel
2. Click the **dropdown** in the bottom left of the input box
3. Select **"Agent"** mode
</Step>

<Step title="Give Agent a Complex Task">
  Try this prompt: ``` "Write comprehensive unit tests for the sorting functions
  in this file. Create the tests in a new file using Jest, and make sure to test
  edge cases like empty arrays and single elements." ```
</Step>

<Step title="Watch Agent Work">
Agent will:
- ‚úÖ Analyze your existing code
- ‚úÖ Create a new test file
- ‚úÖ Write comprehensive tests
- ‚úÖ Handle setup and imports
- ‚úÖ Explain what it's doing at each step
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Agent has powerful capabilities including file creation and modification.
  Always review Agent's changes before accepting them.
</Warning>
