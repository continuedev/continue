## Setting active Edit/Apply model

You can configure particular models from your Assistant to be used for Edit and Apply requests (see [How it Works](./how-it-works.md)). Above the main input, click the 3 dots and then the cube icon to expand the `Models` section. Then, you can use the dropdowns to select models to use for Edit and Apply.

See [Edit role](../customize/model-roles/edit.mdx) and [Apply role](../customize/model-roles/apply.mdx) for more details.
