## Input

The input you provide is included in the prompt.

## Highlighted code

The highlighted code youâ€™ve selected is included in the prompt. This is the only section of code that the model will attempt to edit.

## Current file

The entire contents of the file containing your highlighted code selection are included as additional context. This gives the model a broader understanding of the code's environment. If the file is too large to fit within the context window, we will trim the file's contents to fit.
