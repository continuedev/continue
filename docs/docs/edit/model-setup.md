By default, Edit uses the [same model as Chat](../chat/model-setup.mdx), and we recommend [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://hub.continue.dev/anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet) from Anthropic. Visit [the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=edit) to explore other Edit models.

For the best Edit experience, we also recommend setting up an Apply model, specially trained to apply diffs to files. We recommend [Morph v0 Fast Apply](https://hub.continue.dev/morphllm/morph-v0) or [Relace Instant Apply](https://hub.continue.dev/relace/instant-apply). Explore other apply models on the [the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=apply).
