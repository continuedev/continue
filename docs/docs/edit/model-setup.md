By default, Edit uses the [same model as Chat](../chat/model-setup.mdx) since we recommend a similar, 400B+ parameter model or one of the frontier model for code edits.

Visit [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=edit) to explore Edit models.

You can configure a different model to be used for edits by updating your [configuration](../customize/model-roles/edit.mdx).
