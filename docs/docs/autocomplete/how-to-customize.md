Continue offers a handful of parameters in [`config.json`](../reference.md) that can be tuned to find the perfect balance between suggestion quality and system performance for your specific needs and hardware capabilities:

```json title="config.json"
 "tabAutocompleteOptions": {
   "maxPromptTokens": 400,
   "prefixPercentage": 0.5,
   "multilineCompletions": "always"
 }
```

- `maxPromptTokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens for the prompt, balancing context and speed.
- `prefixPercentage`: Defines the proportion of the prompt dedicated to the code before the cursor.
- `multilineCompletions`: Controls whether suggestions can span multiple lines ("always", "never", or "auto").

For a comprehensive guide on all configuration options and their impacts, see the [Autocomplete deep dive](../customize/deep-dives/autocomplete.md).
