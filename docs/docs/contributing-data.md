# Contributing data

You might have noticed the toggle at the bottom of the Continue GUI. Right now, all it does is send anonymous telemetry about whether it is on or off. **No data is being collected.** We are using it to gather feedback as to whether or not developers would be willing to contribute data about their software development workflows to an open-source dataset.

If there are enough developers who signal interest, we will then move forward with collecting data from those who opt-in and make the dataset publicly accessible. Our hope is that this dataset could then be used by anyone to train a new class of [foundation models](https://fsi.stanford.edu/publication/opportunities-and-risks-foundation-models) for software development that can help us not only “tab autocomplete” but also “task autocomplete” as we create software.

There will be many discussions and iterations with the community before we consider collecting the dataset in order to ensure that the approach works for them, and in no situation will any action taken prior to this point cause users to have their data collected without clear, additional consent. If you have thoughts or questions about this, please reach out to us at contribute@continue.dev. We want to hear from you!

In summary, this is what you should do:

- Toggle data contribution `on` when you would be willing to share your software development data to a public dataset **in the future**

- Toggle data contribution `off` when you would not be willing to share your software development data to a public dataset **in the future**
