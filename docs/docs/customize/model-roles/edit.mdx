It's often useful to select a different model to respond to Edit prompts than for chat prompts, as Edits are often more code-specific and may require less conversational readability.

In Continue, you can add `edit` to a model's roles to specify that it can be used for Edit requests. If no edit models are specified, the selected `chat` model is used.

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
  Use model roles.
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  models:
    - name: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
      provider: anthropic
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
      apiKey: <YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>
      roles:
        - edit
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
  Set the `experimental.modelRoles.inlineEdit` property in `config.json`.
  ```json title="config.json"
