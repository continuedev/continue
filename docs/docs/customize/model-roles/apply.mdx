When editing code, Chat and Edit model output often doesn't clearly align with existing code. A model with the `apply` role is used to generate a more precise diff to apply changes to a file.

Generally speaking, models proficient in chat and edit can also be used for applying code.

Explore apply models in [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=apply).

## Prompt templating

You can customize the prompt template used for applying code changes by setting the `promptTemplates.apply` property in your model configuration. Continue uses [Handlebars syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) for templating.

Available variables for the apply template:

- `{{{original_code}}}` - The original code before changes
- `{{{new_code}}}` - The new code after changes

Example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: My Custom Apply Template
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
    promptTemplates:
      apply: |
        Original: {{{original_code}}}
        New: {{{new_code}}}

        Please generate the final code without any markers or explanations.
```
