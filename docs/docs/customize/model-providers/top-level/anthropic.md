## Prompt caching

Anthropic supports [prompt caching with Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).

To enable caching of the system message and the turn-by-turn conversation, update your your model configuration as following:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      // Enable prompt caching
      "cacheBehavior": {
        "cacheSystemMessage": true,
        "cacheConversation": true
      },
      "title": "Anthropic",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
      "apiKey": "[API_KEY]"
    }
  ]
}
```
