A "chat model" is an LLM that is trained to respond in a conversational format. Because they should be able to answer general questions and generate complex code, the best chat models are typically large, often 405B+ parameters. In Continue, these models are used for [Chat](../../chat/how-to-use-it.md), [Edit](../../edit/how-to-use-it.md), and [Actions](../../actions/how-to-use-it.md).

## Recommended Chat models

If you have the ability to use any model, we recommend [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](../model-providers/top-level/anthropic.md).

Otherwise, some of the next best options are:

- [GPT-4o](../model-providers/top-level/openai.md)
- [Gemini 1.5 Pro](../model-providers/top-level/gemini.md)
- [Llama3.1 405B](../tutorials/llama3.1.md)
