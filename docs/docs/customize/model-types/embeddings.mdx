An "embeddings model" is trained to convert a piece of text into a vector, which can later be rapidly compared to other vectors to determine similarity between the pieces of text. Embeddings models are typically much smaller than LLMs, and will be extremely fast and cheap in comparison.

In Continue, embeddings are generated during indexing and then used by [@Codebase](../deep-dives/codebase.mdx) to perform similarity search over your codebase.

:::info[Default model (VS Code only)]
`transformers.js` is used as a default embeddings model in VS Code. In JetBrains, there currently is no default.

:::info[Free Trial]
The free trial supports embeddings (provider: `free-trial`)

## Recommended embedding models

If you have the ability to use any model, we recommend `voyage-code-3`, which is listed below along with the rest of the options for embeddings models.

If you want to generate embeddings locally, we recommend using `nomic-embed-text` with [Ollama](../model-providers/top-level/ollama.mdx#embeddings-model).

### Voyage AI

After obtaining an API key from [here](https://www.voyageai.com/), you can configure like this:

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
    <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    ```yaml title="Package or config.yaml"
    models:
      - name: Voyage Code 3
        provider: voyage
        model: voyage-code-3
        apiKey: <YOUR_VOYAGE_API_KEY>
        roles: 
          - embed
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
    ```json title="config.json"
    {
      "embeddingsProvider": {
        "provider": "voyage",
        "model": "voyage-code-3",
        "apiKey": "<YOUR_VOYAGE_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Ollama

See [here](../model-providers/top-level/ollama.mdx#embeddings-model) for instructions on how to use Ollama for embeddings.

### Transformers.js (currently VS Code only)

[Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) is a JavaScript port of the popular [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library. It allows embeddings to be calculated entirely locally. The model used is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, which is shipped alongside the Continue extension.

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
    <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
    ```yaml title="Package or config.yaml"
    models:
      - name: default-transformers
        provider: transformers.js
        roles:
          - embed
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
    ```json title="config.json"
    {
      "embeddingsProvider": {
        "provider": "transformers.js"
      }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Text Embeddings Inference

[Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-embeddings-inference/en/index) enables you to host your own embeddings endpoint. You can configure embeddings to use your endpoint as follows:

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
  ```yaml title="Package or config.yaml"
  models:
    - name: Huggingface TEI Embedder
      provider: huggingface-tei
      apiBase: http://localhost:8080
      roles: [embed]
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "embeddingsProvider": {
      "provider": "huggingface-tei",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:8080"
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
