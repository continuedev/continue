# Rules

Rules provide instructions to the model for [Chat](../../chat/how-to-use-it.md), [Edit](../../edit/how-to-use-it.md), and [Agent](../../agent/how-to-use-it.md) requests.

:::info Rules are not included in [autocomplete](./autocomplete.mdx) or [apply](../model-roles/apply.mdx).
:::

## How it works

You can view the current rules by clicking the pen icon above the main toolbar:

![rules input toolbar section](/img/notch-rules.png)

To form the system message, rules are joined with new lines, in the order they appear in the toolbar. This includes the base chat system message ([see below](#chat-system-message)).

## Quick Start

Below is a quick example of setting up a new rule file:

1. Create a folder called `.continue/rules` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `pirates-rule.md` to this folder.
3. Write the following contents to `pirates-rule.md` and save.

```md title=".continue/rules/pirates-rule.md"
---
name: Pirate rule
---

- Talk like a pirate.
```

Now test your rules by asking a question about a file in chat.

## Creating `rules` blocks

Rules can be added locally using the "Add Rules" button while viewing the Local Assistant's rules.

![add local rules button](/img/add-local-rules.png)

:::info Automatically create local rule blocks
When in Agent mode, you can prompt the agent to create a rule for you using the `builtin_create_rule_block` tool if enabled.

For example, you can say "Create a rule for this", and a rule will be created for you in `.continue/rules` based on your conversation.
:::

Rules can also be added to an Assistant on the Continue Hub.

Explore available rules [here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/rules), or [create your own](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=rules) in the Hub. These blocks are defined using the [`config.yaml` syntax](../../reference.md#rules) and can also be created locally.

### Syntax

Rules blocks can be simple text, written in YAML configuration files, or as Markdown (`.md`) files. They can have the following properties:

- `name` (**required** for YAML): A display name/title for the rule
- `globs` (optional): When files are provided as context that match this glob pattern, the rule will be included. This can be either a single pattern (e.g., `"**/*.{ts,tsx}"`) or an array of patterns (e.g., `["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**/*.ts"]`).
- `description` (optional): A description for the rule. Agents may read this description when `alwaysApply` is false to determine whether the rule should be pulled into context.
- `alwaysApply`: true - Always include the rule, regardless of file context
- `alwaysApply`: false - Included if globs exist AND match file context, or the agent decides to pull the rule into context based on it's description
- `alwaysApply`: undefined - Default behavior: include if no globs exist OR globs exist and match

# Continue Docs Standards

- Follow Docusaurus documentation standards
- Include YAML frontmatter with title, description, and keywords
- Use consistent heading hierarchy starting with h2 (##)
- Include relevant Admonition components for tips, warnings, and info
- Use descriptive alt text for images
- Include cross-references to related documentation
- Reference other docs with relative paths
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags

### `.continue/rules` folder

You can create project-specific rules by adding a `.continue/rules` folder to the root of your project and adding new rule files.

```md title=".continue/rules/new-rule.md"
---
name: New rule
---

Always give concise responses
```

This is also done when selecting "Add Rule" in the Assistant settings. This will create a new folder in `.continue/rules` with a default file named `new-rule.md`.

### Examples

If you want concise answers:

```md title=".continue/rules/concise-rule.md"
---
name: Always give concise answers
---

Please provide concise answers. Don't explain obvious concepts.
You can assume that I am knowledgable about most programming topics.
```

If you want to ensure certain practices are followed, for example in React:

```md title=".continue/rules/functional-rule.md"
---
name: Always use functional components
---

Whenever you are writing React code, make sure to

- use functional components instead of class components
- use hooks for state management
- define an interface for your component props
- use Tailwind CSS for styling
- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
```

### Chat System Message

Continue includes a simple default system message for [Chat](../../chat/how-to-use-it.md) and [Agent](../../agent/how-to-use-it.md) requests, to help the model provide reliable codeblock formats in its output.

This can be viewed in the rules section of the toolbar (see above), or visit the source code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/constructMessages.ts#L4)

Advanced users can override this system message for a specific model if needed by using `chatOptions.baseSystemMessage`. See the [`config.yaml` reference](../../reference.md#models).

### `.continuerules`

:::warning

`.contninuerules` will be deprecated in a future release. Please use the `.continue/rules` folder instead.

:::

You can create project-specific rules by adding a `.continuerules` file to the root of your project. This file is raw text and its full contents will be used as rules.
