# MCP

As AI systems get better, they're still held back by their training data and
can't access real-time information or specialized tools. The [Model Context
Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) fixes this by
letting AI models connect with outside data sources, tools, and environments.
This allows smooth sharing of information and abilities between AI systems and
the wider digital world. This standard, created by Anthropic to bring together
prompts, context, and tool use, is key for building truly useful AI experiences
that can be set up with custom tools.

## How it works

Currently custom tools can be configured using the Model Context
Protocol standard to unify prompts, context, and tool use.

MCP Servers can be added to hub Assistants using `mcpServers` blocks. You can
explore available MCP server blocks
[here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/mcp).

:::info
MCP can only be used in the **agent** mode.

## Quick Start

Below is a quick example of setting up a new MCP server for use in your assistant:

1. Create a folder called `.continue/mcpServers` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `playwright-mcp.yaml` to this folder.
3. Write the following contents to `playwright-mcp.yaml` and save.

```yaml title=".continue/mcpServers/playwright-mcp.yaml"
name: Playwright mcpServer
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: Browser search
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@playwright/mcp@latest"
```

Now test your MCP server by prompting the following command:

```
Open the browser and navigate Hacker News. Save the top 10 headlines in a hn.txt file.
```

The result will be a generated file called `hn.txt` in the current working directory.

## Using MCP Servers

To set up your own MCP server, read the [MCP
quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) and then [create an
`mcpServers`
block](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=mcpServers) or add a local MCP
server block to your [config file](./configuration.md):

<Tabs groupId="config.yaml">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  mcpServers:
    - name: SQLite MCP
      command: npx
      args:
        - "-y"
        - "mcp-sqlite"
        - "/path/to/your/database.db"

````
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
```json title="config.json"
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServers": [
      {
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/path/to/your/database.db"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
````

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Syntax

MCP blocks follow the established syntax for blocks, with a few additional properties specific to MCP servers.

- `name` (**required**): A display name for the MCP server.
- `command` (**required**): The command to run to start the MCP server.
- `type` (optional): The type of the MCP server: `sse`, `stdio`, `streamable-http`
- `args` (optional): Arguments to pass to the command.
- `env` (optional): Secrets to be injected into the command as environment variables.

### Transport Types

MCP now supports remote server connections through HTTP-based transports, expanding beyond the traditional local stdio transport method. This enables integration with cloud-hosted MCP servers and distributed architectures.

#### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Transport

For real-time streaming communication, use the SSE transport:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: Name
    type: sse
    url: https://....
```

#### Standard Input/Output (stdio)

For local MCP servers that communicate via standard input and output:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: Name
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite"
      - "/path/to/your/database.db"
```

#### Streamable HTTP Transport

For standard HTTP-based communication with streaming capabilities:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: Name
    type: streamable-http
    url: https://....
```

These remote transport options allow you to connect to MCP servers hosted on remote infrastructure, enabling more flexible deployment architectures and shared server resources across multiple clients.

For detailed information about transport mechanisms and their use cases, refer to the official MCP documentation on [transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse).

### Working with Secrets

With some MCP servers you will need to use API keys or other secrets. You can leverage locally stored environments secrets
as well as access hosted secrets in the Continue Hub. To leverage Hub secrets, you can use the `inputs` property in your MCP env block instead of `secrets`.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: Supabase MCP
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest"
      - --access-token
      - ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_TOKEN }}
    env:
      SUPABASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_TOKEN }}
  - name: GitHub
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
