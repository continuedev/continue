# `.continuerules`

You can create a project-specific system message by adding a `.continuerules` file to the root of your project. This file is raw text and its contents will be inserted into the system message for all chat requests. Rules are not used for autocomplete.

## Simple Examples

- If you want concise answers:

```title=.continuerules
Please provide concise answers. Don't explain obvious concepts. You can assume that I am knowledgable about most programming topics.
```

- If you want to ensure certain practices are followed, for example in React:

```title=.continuerules
Whenever you are writing React code, make sure to
- use functional components instead of class components
- use hooks for state management
- define an interface for your component props
- use Tailwind CSS for styling
- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
```
