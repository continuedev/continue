Continue makes it easy to code with the latest open-source models, including the entire Llama 3.1 family of models.

If you haven't already installed Continue, you can do that [here for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) or [here for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue). For more general information on customizing Continue, read [our customization docs](../overview.md).

Below we share some of the easiest ways to get up and running, depending on your use-case.

## Ollama

Ollama is the fastest way to get up and running with local language models. We recommend trying Llama 3.1 8b, which is impressive for its size and will perform well on most hardware.

1. Download Ollama [here](https://ollama.ai/) (it should walk you through the rest of these steps)
2. Open a terminal and run `ollama run llama3.1:8b`
3. Change your Continue config file like this:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Llama 3.1 8b",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "llama3.1-8b"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Groq

Groq provides the fastest available inference for open-source language models, including the entire Llama 3.1 family.

1. Obtain an API key [here](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Update your Continue config file like this:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Llama 3.1 405b",
      "provider": "groq",
      "model": "llama3.1-405b",
      "apiKey": "<API_KEY>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Together AI provides fast and reliable inference of open-source models. You'll be able to run the 405b model with good speed.

3. Update your Continue config file like this:

      "apiKey": "<API_KEY>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replicate makes it easy to host and run open-source AI with an API.

1. Get your Replicate API key [here](https://replicate.ai/)
