[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/continuedev/continue-codespaces-demo?quickstart=1)

1. Click the `Open in GitHub Codespaces` badge above

:::tip
We don't want to waste your time with install and env setup before you try Continue, so we set up a GitHub Codespace for you, which **wonâ€™t cost you anything**. If you are using GitHub Free for personal accounts, you can [use Codespaces for 120 hours per month for free](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)

2. Select the `Create new codespace` button and wait 30-90 seconds while it launches and installs the Continue extension. Once complete, it should look like this:
