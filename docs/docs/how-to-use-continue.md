Continue is an advanced tool designed to help you integrate the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) seamlessly into your coding environment, providing assistance with understanding code, generating boilerplate, refactoring, and much more. Below are detailed instructions on how you can make the most out of Continue across different integrated development environments (IDEs) like VS Code and JetBrains.

## Easily Understand Code Sections

If you ever find yourself puzzled by a piece of code, Continue can help break it down for you. This feature gives you a clear and concise explanation which can significantly speed up the debugging and understanding process.

- **VS Code**: Press `cmd+L` (MacOS) or `ctrl+L` (Windows) to get insights into the current code section you are working on.
- **JetBrains**: Utilize the same feature with `cmd+J` (MacOS) or `ctrl+J` (Windows).

## Tab to Autocomplete Code Suggestions

Autocomplete can save you time by predicting and inserting code snippets. Continue enhances this feature by using AI to offer smarter autocomplete suggestions tailored to your context.

- **VS Code**: Simply press `tab` (MacOS) or `tab` (Windows) to autocomplete code suggestions.
- **JetBrains**: Similar functionality is available with the `tab` key on both MacOS and Windows.

## Refactor Functions Where You are Coding

Refactoring is a crucial part of maintaining and improving your code. With Continue, you can refactor functions right where you are coding, ensuring seamless transitions and minimal interruptions.

- **VS Code**: Press `cmd+I` (MacOS) or `ctrl+I` (Windows) to refactor in place.
- **JetBrains**: Trigger the same action using `cmd+I` (MacOS) or `ctrl+I` (Windows).

## Ask Questions About Your Codebase

Continue allows you to ask questions about your entire codebase, which can be extremely useful for getting quick answers and making informed decisions.

- **VS Code**: Type `@codebase` followed by your query, or use `cmd+Enter`
- **JetBrains**: Type `@codebase` followed by your query, or use `cmd+Enter`

## Quickly Use Documentation as Context

Documentation can often be complex and time-consuming to scroll through. Continue can fetch the relevant sections for you, allowing you to use documentation as context efficiently.

- **VS Code**: Use the `@docs` command (available on both MacOS and Windows).
- **JetBrains**: The same functionality is available using `@docs` on both MacOS and Windows.

## Kick Off Actions with Slash Commands

Slash commands in Continue enable you to perform various actions quickly and efficiently without having to leave your coding environment.

- **VS Code**: Start commands with a `/` (works on both MacOS and Windows) like `/edit`.
- **JetBrains**: Support the use of slash commands by typing `/edit` on MacOS or Windows.

## Add Classes, Files, and More to Context

Context switching can disrupt your workflow. Continue allows you to add classes, files, and more to your current context, allowing you to see everything you need in one place.

- **VS Code**: Use the `@files` command (available on both MacOS and Windows) for this purpose.
- **JetBrains**: This feature can also be utilized using `@files` on MacOS and Windows.

## Understand Terminal Errors Immediately

One of the most frustrating parts of coding is deciphering terminal errors. Continue can help you understand these errors instantly, reducing downtime and confusion.

- **VS Code**: Press `cmd+shift+R` (MacOS) or `ctrl+shift+R` (Windows) for instant error explanations.
- **JetBrains**: This feature will be supported soon.
