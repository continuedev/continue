# Use an assistant

To use an existing assistant, you can explore other assistants [here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/assistants).

Once you've found the assistant you want to use

1. Click “Add Assistant” on its page
2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)
3. Select “Save changes” in assistant sidebar on the right hand side

After this, you can then go to your IDE extension and begin using the assistant by selecting it from the assistant dropdown.
