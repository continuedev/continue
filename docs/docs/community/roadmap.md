1. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues): Browse open issues to see what bugs are being tracked and what features are being requested.

2. [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/continuedev/projects/2): Check our project board (if available) for a more visual representation of our current priorities and work in progress.

3. [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/NWtdYexhMs): Join our Discord community to discuss upcoming features, provide feedback, and stay updated on the latest developments.

We encourage community members to contribute ideas and discuss potential features in these spaces. Your input helps shape the future direction of the project!
