**Continue is the open-source autopilot for software developmentâ€”a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) that brings the power of ChatGPT to your IDE**

You determine when Large Language Models (LLMs) like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) and [Code Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/) should act as an autopilot, helping you complete software development tasks. You highlight some code and then use natural language instructions (and optional slash commands like `/edit`) to tell the LLM what to do.

Many developers have begun to use ChatGPT while coding; however, the experience is painful because of how much copying, pasting, and editing is required to provide the context and incorporate the generated answers into your codebase. Continue eliminates this pain by enabling LLMs to natively act in your IDE as you complete your workflows.
