## Quickstart

Install Continue packaged as a [VS Code extension](./getting-started.md)

## What is Continue?

**Continue is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

You determine when Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 should act as an autopilot, helping you complete software development tasks. You open a file or highlight some code and then use slash commands like `/edit`, `/explain`, and `/comment` and naturual language instructions to tell the language model what to do. If an error or exception occurs when you run Python or JavaScript code, Continue will automatically tell you in plain English what to try to address it. You can also review, reverse, and rerun steps with the Continue GUI, which helps you guide the work done by LLMs and learn when to use and trust them.

## Why do developers use Continue?

Many developers have begun to use [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) through [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) while coding; however, the experience is painful because of how much manual copying, pasting, and editing is required to provide the necessary context and incorporate the generated solutions and advice into your codebase. Continue eliminates this pain by enabling LLMs to natively act in your IDE as you complete your workflows.

Continue accelerates how developers build, ship, and maintain software, while giving them the control to define when LLMs should take actions and the confidence to trust LLMs. In short, it enables developers to do what they have always done: work together to create better and better abstractions that make it easier and easier to automate the repetitive work that people want computers to do.
