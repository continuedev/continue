# Installation

:::note
If you want to try Continue before installing locally, check out the [GitHub Codespaces Demo](./getting-started.md)
:::

## Install Continue locally in VS Code

1. Click `Install` on the Continue extension in the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)

2. This will open the Continue extension page in VS Code, where you will need to click `Install` again

3. Once you do this, you will see a message in the bottom right hand corner of VS Code that says `Setting up Continue extension...`. After 30-90 seconds, the Continue extension will then open up. It should look like this when it is complete:

![vscode-install](/img/vscode-install.png)

You can also open the Continue GUI with `cmd+shift+p` on Mac / `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows and then selecting `Continue: Open GUI`

:::note
If you would like to install Continue from source, please [follow the instructions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/README.md) in the repo README.
