# Collecting data

When you use Continue, you automatically collect data on how you build software. By default, this development data is saved to `.continue/dev_data` on your local machine. When combined with the code that you ultimately commit, it can be used to improve the LLM that you or your team use (if you allow).

You can read more about how development data is generated as a byproduct of LLM-aided development and why we believe that you should start collecting it now: blog.continue.dev/its-time-to-collect-data-on-how-you-build-software
