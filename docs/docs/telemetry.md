# ðŸ¦” Telemetry

## Overview

Continue collects and reports **anonymous** usage information. This data is essential to understanding how we should improve the product. You can opt out of it at any time. We use [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), an open source platform for product analytics, to collect and store the data. You can review the code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/gui/src/hooks/CustomPostHogProvider.tsx).

## What we track

We track

- whether you accept or reject suggestions (not the code itself)
- the name of slash commands that are run
- the name of your OS and IDE
- the name of the default model you configured

All data is anonymous and cleaned of PII before being sent to PostHog.

## How to opt out

The `~/.continue` directory contains a `config.json` file that looks like this:

```json title="~/.continue/config.json"
{
    "allowAnonymousTelemetry": true,
    ...
}
```

You can turn off anonymous telemetry by changing the value of `allowAnonymousTelemetry` to `false`. Alternatively, you can uncheck the "Continue: Telemetry Enabled" box in VS Code settings.
