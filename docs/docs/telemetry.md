# ðŸ¦” Telemetry

## Overview

Continue collects and reports **anonymous** usage information.

This data is essential to understanding how we should improve the product. You can opt out of it at any time.

We use [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), an open source platform for product analytics, to collect and store the data. You can review the code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/gui/src/hooks/CustomPostHogProvider.tsx), or review our official policy [here](https://continue.dev/privacy).

## Tracking policy

All data is anonymous and cleaned of PII before being sent to PostHog.

## What we track

- Whether you accept or reject suggestions (never including the code or the prompt)
- The name of the model and slash command used
- The number of tokens generated
- The name of your OS and IDE
- Pageviews

## How to opt out

The `~/.continue` directory contains a `config.json` file that looks like this:

```json title="~/.continue/config.json"
{
    "allowAnonymousTelemetry": true,
    ...
}
```

You can turn off anonymous telemetry by changing the value of `allowAnonymousTelemetry` to `false`. Alternatively, you can uncheck the "Continue: Telemetry Enabled" box in VS Code settings.
