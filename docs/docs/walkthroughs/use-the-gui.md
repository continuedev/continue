:::note
Context is not carried across steps at the moment, so you will need to repeat any information from previous steps if you want the LLM in the current step to be aware of it

## Review actions taken

Whether you are using a recipe or not, you will want to review the explanations of what the LLM did and check the code that it generated. You are ultimately responsible for any code that you ship, even if it was written by a LLM.
