- `Enable Indexing`: Enables indexing of the codebase for the @codebase and @code context providers. **On** by default.

### Experimental settings

At the bottom of the User Settings page there is an "Experimental Settings" section which contains new or otherwise experimental settings, including:

- `Auto-Accept Agent Edits`: **CAUTION: Be very careful with this setting. When turned on, Agent mode's edit tool can make changes to files with no manual review or guaranteed stopping point. If on, diffs generated by the edit tool are automatically accepted and Agent proceeds with the next conversational turn.** Off by default.

<!-- - `Use autocomplete cache`: If on, caches completions. -->
<!-- - `Use Chromium for Docs Crawling`: Use Chromium to crawl docs locally. Useful if the default Cheerio crawler fails on sites that require JavaScript rendering. Downloads and installs Chromium to ~/.continue/.utils. Off by default -->
<!-- - `Codeblock Actions Position`: Sets the position for the actions that show when hovering over codeblocks. Defaults to `top` -->
<!-- - `Workspace prompts path`: Where to find Prompt Files in a workspace - replaces the default .continue/prompts -->
