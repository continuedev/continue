These blocks form the foundation of the entire assistant experience, offering different specialized capabilities:

- **[Chat](../advanced/model-roles/chat.mdx)**: Power conversational interactions about code and provide detailed guidance
- **[Edit](../advanced/model-roles/edit.mdx)**: Handle complex code transformations and refactoring tasks
- **[Apply](../advanced/model-roles/apply.mdx)**: Execute targeted code modifications with high accuracy
- **[Autocomplete](../advanced/model-roles/autocomplete.md)**: Provide real-time suggestions as developers type
- **[Embedding](../advanced/model-roles/embeddings.mdx)**: Transform code into vector representations for semantic search
- **[Reranker](../advanced/model-roles/reranking.mdx)**: Improve search relevance by ordering results based on semantic meaning
