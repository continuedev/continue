# Overview

Continue can be deeply customized by editing `~/.continue/config.json` (`%userprofile%\.continue\config.json` for Windows) and `config.py` on your machine. These files are created the first time you run Continue.

Currently, you can customize the following:

- [Models](./models.md) - Use Continue with any LLM, including local models, Azure OpenAI service, any OpenAI-compatible API, and more.
- [Context Providers](./context-providers.md) - Just type '@' to easily add attachments to your prompt. Define which sources you want to easily reference, including GitHub Issues, terminal output, and preset URLs.
- [Slash Commands](./slash-commands.md) - Call custom prompts or programs written with our SDK by typing `/`.
- [Other Configuration](./other-configuration.md) - Configure other settings like the system message and temperature.
