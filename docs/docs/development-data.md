# Development Data

## Why You Need Development Data

Development data is essential for any organization aiming to optimize its software development process. It provides crucial insights into how software is built by capturing the detailed workflow, context behind decisions, and natural language reasoning used during coding. Collecting and utilizing this data helps in:

- **Improving LLMs**: Enhancing the performance and relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) that assist in coding, making them more accurate and helpful.
- **Understanding Developer Challenges**: Identifying what frustrates developers and how they overcome challenges.
- **Demonstrating ROI**: Calculating the return on investment (ROI) of using LLMs within your organization.
- **Continual Improvement**: Establishing a continuous feedback loop to keep LLMs updated with the latest information, code, and preferred styles.

## Understanding Development Data

### Data Components

- **Step-by-Step Process**: Detailed record of each step taken while completing a task.
- **Context Capture**: Information used to make decisions, such as code snippets, documentation, and logs.
- **Natural Language Reasoning**: Explanations and decisions made in natural language during coding.

### Data Storage

By default, the development data collected by Continue is stored locally on your machine in the directory `~/.continue/dev_data`.

The data remains within your control on your local machine. If you choose to share your data with Continue for improving LLMs or other services, you must give explicit consent. If you are interested in working with us, please email us at [data@continue.dev](mailto:data@continue.dev).

## Utilizing Development Data

When combined with the code you commit, the development data can significantly improve the performance and relevance of LLMs. This results in more accurate suggestions and assistance during coding. Continue helps establish a continuous feedback loop to ensure LLMs always have fresh information, code, and preferred styles.

Continue plays a critical role in leveraging development data for enhancing LLMs:

- **Automatic Data Collection**: Continue automatically collects development data, including the step-by-step process, context, and natural language reasoning.
  
- **Improvement of LLMs**: The collected data is used to create a continuous feedback loop, ensuring the LLMs are constantly updated with fresh and relevant information, thus improving their performance and accuracy.

- **Development Data Engine**: Continue aids organizations in setting up development data engines. These engines offer visibility into how developers interact with LLMs, help calculate the ROI, identify frustrations, and enhance the models to overcome challenges.

- **Open-Source Coding Autopilot**: Continue is building an open-source coding autopilot that enables the automatic collection and utilization of development data, providing flexibility, customization, and better privacy and security.

- **Customized Improvement**: Continue allows teams to track and improve the metrics that matter most to their specific definitions of "great" software.

- **Addressing Budget and Data Staleness**: Continue supports organizations in justifying their LLM budgets and managing data staleness by helping them extract, load, and transform their data effectively.

## Privacy, Security, and Additional Resources

Understanding the privacy and security implications of development data collection is crucial. Ensure that sensitive information is safeguarded and that data collection aligns with your organization's privacy policies. For more detailed insights and guidelines, refer to the following:
