# Overview

Continue is the easiest way to code with any [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g). You can use it with commercial models like GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, open-source models running on your laptop with Ollama like Code Llama, and everything in between. You have the ability to configure what model you use, what provider you use, and how you use them.

When you first install Continue, you can try it out for free using a proxy server that securely makes calls with our API key to models like GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and Phind CodeLlama via OpenAI, Google, and Together respectively.

Once you're ready to use your own API key or a different model / provider, press the `+` button in the bottom left to add a new model to your `config.json`.

If you are unsure what model or provider to use, here is a rule of thumb:
- Use GPT-4 via OpenAI if you want the best possible model overall right now
- Use X via Together if you want the best open-source model right now
- Use X via Ollama if you want to run a model locally on Mac or Linux
- Use X via LM Studio if you want to run a model locally on Windows
