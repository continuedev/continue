# Overview

Continue is the easiest way to code with any [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g). You can use it with commercial models like GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, open-source models like CodeLlama running on your laptop with Ollama, and everything in between.

When you first install Continue, you can try it out for free using a proxy server that securely makes calls with our API keys to models like GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and Phind CodeLlama via OpenAI, Google, and Together respectively.

Once you're ready to use your own API key or a different model / provider, press the `+` button in the bottom left to add a new model to your `config.json`.

If you are unsure what model or provider to use, here is a rule of thumb:

- Use GPT-4 via OpenAI if you want the best possible model overall right now
- Use Phind CodeLlama or Mixtral 8x7B via Together if you want the best open-source model right now
- Use CodeLlama via Ollama if you want to run a model locally on Mac or Linux
- Use CodeLlama via LM Studio if you want to run a model locally on Windows
