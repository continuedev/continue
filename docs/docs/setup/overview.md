# Overview

Continue gives you choice over what [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) you use. You can use it with commercial models like Claude 3 Opus via the Anthropic API, open-source models like Llama 3 running on your laptop with Ollama, and everything in between.

When you first install Continue, you can try it out for free using a proxy server that securely makes calls with our API keys. Once you're ready to use your own API keys or different models / providers, you can add them to the `config.json`.

You will need to decide which models and providers you use for [chat](select-model.md#chat), [autocomplete](select-model.md#autocomplete), and [embeddings](select-model.md#embeddings).
