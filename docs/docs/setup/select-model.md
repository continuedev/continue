# Select models

Continue makes it easy to use different models for chat, autocomplete, and embeddings. To select the models you want to use, add them to your `config.json`.

## Chat

You likely want to use a model that is 30B+ parameters for chat.

### Open-source LLMs

*We currently recommend the following open-source models:*

#### Llama 3 from Meta

- Unlimited GPU: `llama3-70b`
- Limited GPU: `llama3-8B`

#### DeepSeek Coder from DeepSeek

- Unlimited GPU: `deepseek-coder-33b`
- Limited GPU: `deepseek-coder-6.7b`

*You can also use other open-source chat models by adding them to your `config.json`.*

### Commercial LLMs

You likely want to use an embeddings model that is made to vectorize code.

### Open-source models

- `transformers.js`
- `nomic-embed-text`

### Commercial models

- `voyage-code-2`



*You can also use other embeddings models by adding them to your `config.json`.*
