While many Actions are based on templated prompts and can be customized with .prompt files, there are a number that execute more complex code under the hood.

Actions that generate inline diffs, like “/edit”, “/comment”, or right click actions, use the same prompt and response processing logic as [Edit](edit/how-it-works.md).

To learn how other slash commands work, see the full reference [here](../customize/slash-commands.md).
