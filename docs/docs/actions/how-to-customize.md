The easiest way to add actions is by adding [`prompt` blocks](../hub/blocks/block-types.md#prompts) to your assistant, which show up as slash commands in [Chat](../chat/how-it-works.md).

Check out the [slash commands deep dive](../customize/slash-commands.mdx) for more information on extending actions.
