## What is Continue?

**Continue enables developers to create, share, and use custom AI code assistants with our open source [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) and [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue-extension) extensions and [hub of models, rules, prompts, docs, and other building blocks](https://hub.continue.dev)**

## Key Features

**You can use Continue to build and run custom agents across your IDE, terminal, and CI.**
