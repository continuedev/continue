<OSAutoDetect />

Continue CLI (`cn`) is a terminal-based coding agent. It can edit files, run commands, and work through multi-step tasks — the same agent that powers the Continue IDE extensions, running in your terminal.

## Install

<CLIInstall />

## First run

```bash
cd your-project
cn
```

On first launch you'll be asked to log in with [Continue](https://continue.dev) or enter an Anthropic API key. After that, you're in a session and can start typing.

## Two modes

**[TUI mode](/cli/tui-mode)** — run `cn` to start an interactive session. You type messages, reference files with `@`, approve tool calls, and iterate with the agent. This is the default.

**[Headless mode](/cli/headless-mode)** — run `cn -p "your prompt"` for single-shot automation. The agent runs to completion and prints its response to stdout. Use this in scripts, CI/CD, and git hooks.

## Common flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `-p "prompt"` | Headless mode — run prompt and exit |
| `--config <path or slug>` | Use a specific config file or assistant |
| `--resume` | Resume the most recent session |
| `--auto` | Allow all tools without prompting |
| `--readonly` | Plan mode — read-only tools only |
| `--allow <tool>` | Allow a specific tool (repeatable) |
| `--exclude <tool>` | Exclude a specific tool (repeatable) |
| `--rule <rule>` | Add a rule — file path, hub slug, or string (repeatable) |
| `--mcp <slug>` | Add an MCP server from the hub (repeatable) |
| `--model <slug>` | Add a model from the hub (repeatable) |
| `--agent <slug>` | Load an agent file from the hub |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging |

Run `cn --help` for the full list.
