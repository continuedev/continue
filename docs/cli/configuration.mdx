title: "Configuration"
---

`cn` resolves its configuration (models, MCP servers, rules, etc.) from several sources, in this order:

1. **`--config` flag** — a file path or hub assistant slug passed at launch
2. **Saved config** — the last-used configuration, persisted across sessions
3. **Default** — your first assistant from [Continue](https://continue.dev), or `~/.continue/config.yaml` if you're not logged in

## `--config` flag

Point `cn` at a local YAML file or a hub assistant:

```bash
# Local file
cn --config ./my-config.yaml

# Hub assistant
cn --config my-org/my-assistant
```

This overrides any saved preference for the current session.

## Switching at runtime

Use `/config` inside a TUI session to switch between available configurations:

```
> /config
```

This shows your available assistants and local configs. The selection is saved for next time.

## `config.yaml`

If you're not logged in to Continue, `cn` looks for `~/.continue/config.yaml`. This file uses the same format as the IDE extensions — see [config.yaml reference](/customize/deep-dives/configuration) for the full schema.

## CLI-specific flags

Several flags inject configuration at launch without editing a file:

```bash
# Add models from the hub
cn --model my-org/claude-sonnet

# Add MCP servers from the hub
cn --mcp my-org/github-mcp

# Add rules (file path, hub slug, or inline string)
cn --rule ./rules/style.md
cn --rule my-org/code-review-rules
cn --rule "Always use TypeScript strict mode"

# Load an agent file from the hub
cn --agent my-org/pr-reviewer
```

All of these are repeatable — pass them multiple times to add multiple items.

## Organization

If you belong to multiple organizations on Continue, use `--org` to specify which one:

```bash
cn --org my-team -p "Review this PR"
```

In TUI mode, `/config` lets you switch organizations interactively.

## Secrets

Store sensitive values (API keys, tokens) in [Continue → Settings → Secrets](https://continue.dev/settings/secrets). Reference them in config with:

```yaml
${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}
```
