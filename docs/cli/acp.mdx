Continue CLI can run as an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server over stdio. This
lets editors like Zed connect directly to Continue for streaming responses and
tool execution.

## Requirements

- Continue CLI installed (`cn` on your PATH)
- A valid Continue config with at least one model
- Zed with External Agents enabled

## Configure Zed

Add an external agent entry to `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Continue": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional flags

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Continue (Read-only)": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp", "--readonly"]
    },
    "Continue (Custom Config)": {
      "command": "cn",
      "args": ["acp", "--config", "/path/to/config.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Use in Zed

1. Open a workspace in Zed.
2. Open the AI panel and select the Continue agent.
3. Send prompts as usual. Continue streams via ACP.

## Notes

- ACP mode defaults to auto-approve tool access. Use `--readonly` for a
  read-only session.
- ACP currently supports `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, and
  `session/set_mode`. Session loading is not yet available.
- MCP servers provided by the client are ignored; configure MCP servers in your
  Continue config instead.
