Run `cn` to start an interactive session. You get a prompt where you can type messages, reference files with `@`, and use slash commands. `cn` uses the same underlying agent as the Continue IDE extensions.

## `@` Context

Use `@` to point the agent at specific files or directories:

```
> @src/auth/middleware.ts Why is this middleware rejecting valid tokens?
> @tests/ Write missing test cases for the auth module
> @package.json @tsconfig.json Help me set up path aliases
```

The agent reads the referenced files and uses them as context for its response.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` to see available commands. Run `/help` for the full list.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | Switch between configured chat models |
| `/config` | Switch configuration or organization |
| `/compact` | Summarize chat history to free up context |
| `/fork` | Branch the conversation from the current point |
| `/resume` | Pick up a previous session |
| `/info` | Show token usage and cost for this session |
| `/init` | Create an `AGENTS.md` file for the current project |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP server connections |

## Resume previous sessions

Pick up where you left off:

```bash
# Resume the most recent session
cn --resume

# Or use the slash command inside a session
> /resume
```

This restores the full conversation history, so the agent remembers prior context.

## Tool Permissions

Tools that can modify your system (file writes, terminal commands) prompt for approval before executing. You get three options:

- **Continue** — approve this call
- **Continue + don't ask again** — approve and save a policy rule to `~/.continue/permissions.yaml`
- **No** — reject the call and give the agent new instructions

Read-only tools (`Read`, `List`, `Search`, `Fetch`) run automatically. See [tool permissions](/cli/tool-permissions) for the full policy system.
