import { OSAutoDetect } from '/snippets/OSAutoDetect.jsx'
import CLIInstall from '/snippets/cli-install.mdx'

<OSAutoDetect />

<CLIInstall />

Verify the installation:

```bash
cn --version
```

## Authentication

### Log in with Continue

```bash
cn login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate with [Continue](https://continue.dev). Once authenticated, `cn` can use your configured assistants, models, and MCP servers from the platform.

### API key (headless / CI)

For automation environments where there's no browser, set the `CONTINUE_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export CONTINUE_API_KEY=your-key-here
cn -p "your prompt"
```

Get an API key from [Continue → Settings → API Keys](https://continue.dev/settings/api-keys).

### Local API key

If you don't want to use Continue, you can use an Anthropic API key directly. On first launch, `cn` will prompt you to choose between logging in with Continue or entering an Anthropic API key.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+** — needed for the npm install path. The shell installer bundles its own runtime.
- A [Continue](https://continue.dev) account, or an Anthropic API key.
