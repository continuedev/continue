<Card title="Artifact Uploads (Beta)" icon="upload">
  Enable your CLI agents to upload screenshots, videos, and logs to agent session storage for debugging and user review.
</Card>

## Overview

The artifact upload feature allows Continue agents running in CLI mode to upload files directly to session storage. This is useful for:

- **Visual debugging**: Agents can capture and upload screenshots of errors or UI states
- **Log collection**: Upload detailed log files for analysis
- **Video recordings**: Capture screen recordings for complex issues

<Info>
  This feature is currently in beta and requires the `--beta-upload-artifact-tool` flag to enable.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before using artifact uploads, ensure you have:

- Continue CLI installed (`npm i -g @continuedev/cli`)
- Authenticated with Continue (`cn login`)
- Running agents in serve mode with an agent session ID

## Enabling Artifact Uploads

To enable the `UploadArtifact` tool in your agent session:

```bash
cn serve --id <agentSessionId> --beta-upload-artifact-tool
```

**Required flags:**

- `--id <agentSessionId>`: Specifies the agent session to upload artifacts to
- `--beta-upload-artifact-tool`: Enables the beta artifact upload tool

## Using the UploadArtifact Tool

Once enabled, agents can use the `UploadArtifact` tool to upload files:

```typescript
// The agent calls this tool with the file path
{
  "name": "UploadArtifact",
  "parameters": {
    "filePath": "/tmp/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

### Supported File Types

The following file types are supported:

**Images:**
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`

**Videos:**
- `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.webm`

**Text/Logs:**
- `.log`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.csv`, `.html`

### Size Limits

- **Per-file limit**: 50MB maximum
- **Total session storage**: 500MB maximum

<Warning>
  If an artifact with the same filename already exists in the session, it will be overwritten by the new upload.
</Warning>

## Example Use Cases

### Screenshot Upload

An agent can capture a screenshot and upload it for user review:

```bash
# Agent takes a screenshot
screenshot /tmp/app-error.png

# Agent uploads it
UploadArtifact { "filePath": "/tmp/app-error.png" }
```

### Log File Upload

Upload detailed logs for debugging:

```bash
# Generate logs
npm test > /tmp/test-results.log 2>&1

# Upload logs
UploadArtifact { "filePath": "/tmp/test-results.log" }
```

### Multiple Artifacts

An agent can upload multiple files during a session:

```typescript
// Upload screenshot
UploadArtifact { "filePath": "/tmp/screenshot1.png" }

// Upload related logs
UploadArtifact { "filePath": "/tmp/debug.log" }

// Upload video recording
UploadArtifact { "filePath": "/tmp/recording.mp4" }
```

## Viewing Artifacts

After upload, artifacts are available in the **Artifacts tab** of the agent session in Continue Mission Control:

1. Navigate to [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev)
2. Open the agent session
3. Click the **Artifacts** tab to view all uploaded files

## Error Handling

The tool provides detailed error messages for common issues:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `File not found` | File path doesn't exist | Verify the file path is correct and absolute |
| `File is too large` | File exceeds 50MB limit | Compress the file or split into smaller parts |
| `Storage limit exceeded` | Session has used 500MB total | Delete old artifacts or reduce uploads |
| `File type not supported` | Invalid file extension | Use a supported file format |
| `Authentication required` | Not logged in | Run `cn login` to authenticate |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use absolute paths">
    Always provide absolute file paths (e.g., `/tmp/screenshot.png`) rather than relative paths to avoid confusion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean up temporary files">
    Delete temporary files after uploading to save disk space on the agent machine.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive filenames">
    Name files clearly to make them easy to identify in the Artifacts tab (e.g., `error-login-page.png` instead of `screenshot.png`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compress large files">
    For large screenshots or videos, consider compressing them before upload to stay within the 50MB limit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor storage usage">
    Keep track of total session storage (500MB limit) to avoid hitting the limit during long-running sessions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Programmatic Usage

For custom implementations, you can use the artifact upload service directly:

```typescript
import { services } from "./services/index.js";

// Upload a single file
const result = await services.artifactUpload.uploadArtifact({
  agentSessionId: process.env.AGENT_SESSION_ID,
  filePath: "/tmp/screenshot.png",
  accessToken: process.env.CONTINUE_API_KEY,
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Uploaded: ${result.filename}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Failed: ${result.error}`);
}

// Upload multiple files
const results = await services.artifactUpload.uploadArtifacts(
  process.env.AGENT_SESSION_ID,
  ["/tmp/screenshot1.png", "/tmp/debug.log"],
  process.env.CONTINUE_API_KEY,
);

results.forEach((result) => {
  console.log(`${result.filename}: ${result.success ? "✓" : "✗"}`);
});
```

## Environment Variables

When running in Continue's devbox environment, these variables are automatically set:

- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Authentication token
- `CONTINUE_API_BASE`: API base URL (defaults to `https://api.continue.dev/`)
- `AGENT_SESSION_ID`: Current agent session identifier

## Security

Artifact uploads use a secure two-step process:

1. **Request validation**: Backend validates file size, type, and user permissions
2. **Direct upload**: Files upload directly to S3 using time-limited presigned URLs (15-minute expiry)

This ensures:
- Only authenticated users can upload
- File types and sizes are validated before upload
- No sensitive files can be uploaded (executables are blocked)
- Storage limits prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tool not available in agent">
    Ensure you're running with both `--id <agentSessionId>` and `--beta-upload-artifact-tool` flags.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    Run `cn login` to authenticate. Verify you have a valid Continue API key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File upload fails">
    Check the file exists, is under 50MB, and has a supported extension. Review error messages for specific guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Storage limit reached">
    Delete old artifacts from the session in Mission Control, or wait for automatic cleanup policies to take effect.
  </Accordion>
