Get hands-on experience with Continue CLI through practical development workflows.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TUI Mode">
    TUI Mode (`cn` command) is for **large development tasks** that require
    agentic workflows with human oversight. Perfect for complex refactors,
    feature implementation, or one-off automation tasks that need monitoring and
    iteration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Headless Mode">
    Headless Mode (`-p` flag) is for **reliable, repeatable tasks** that no
    longer need constant supervision. Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, git hooks,
    and automated workflows you've already tested and refined.
  </Tab>

## TUI Mode: Large Development Tasks

Make sure you have [Continue CLI installed](/cli/install) and are in a project directory.

### Example: Implementing a New Feature

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-awesome-project

# Start TUI Mode for complex development work
cn
```

**Example workflow for adding authentication:**

```
> I need to add JWT authentication to this Express app. Let me start by showing you the current structure.

> @src/app.js @package.json Here's my current setup. Can you implement JWT auth with middleware, login/register routes, and user model?

> [Agent analyzes codebase and implements auth system]
> [You review changes, test, and provide feedback]
> [Agent iterates based on your input until the feature is complete]
```

### Example: Complex Refactoring

```bash
cn
```

**Refactoring a monolithic component:**

```
> @src/components/Dashboard.jsx This component is 800 lines and does too much. Help me break it into smaller, reusable components.

> [Agent analyzes component structure]
> [Proposes component breakdown strategy]
> [You approve approach]
> [Agent implements the refactor with proper props and state management]
> [You test and request adjustments]
```

### When to Use TUI Mode

âœ… **Large development tasks** that need oversight  
âœ… **Complex refactors** requiring multiple steps  
âœ… **New feature implementation** with unknowns  
âœ… **One-off automation tasks** you haven't done before  
âœ… **Debugging complex issues** that need exploration

## Headless Mode: Automated Workflows

Once you've refined a workflow in TUI Mode, convert it to Continuous AI for automation.

### Example: From REPL â†’ Continuous AI

**Step 1: Develop in TUI Mode**

```bash
cn
> @package.json @CHANGELOG.md Generate release notes for version 2.1.0
> [Test and refine the prompt until it works perfectly]
```

**Step 2: Convert to Continuous AI**

```bash
# Now use the refined workflow in automation
cn -p "Generate release notes for the current version based on package.json and recent commits"
```

### Common Continuous AI Workflows

```bash
# Git automation
cn -p "Generate a conventional commit message for staged changes"
cn -p "Review the last 3 commits for potential issues"

# Code quality
cn -p "Fix all TypeScript errors in the src/ directory"
cn -p "Update outdated dependencies and fix breaking changes"

# Documentation
cn -p "@README.md Update documentation based on recent changes"
cn -p "Generate API documentation from JSDoc comments"

# CI/CD integration
cn -p "Analyze test failures and create GitHub issue with findings"
cn -p "Update version numbers and create release branch"
```

### When to Use Headless Mode

âœ… **Proven workflows** you've tested in TUI Mode  
âœ… **Repetitive tasks** that no longer need oversight  
âœ… **CI/CD automation** in pipelines  
âœ… **Git hooks** for automated checks  
âœ… **Scheduled tasks** that run unattended

<Info>
  **Tool Permission Differences Between Modes**

  Tools requiring user confirmation ("ask" permission) like `writeFile` and `runTerminalCommand` are:
  - **Available in TUI mode** - AI can use them with your approval
  - **Excluded in headless mode** - AI cannot see or call them

  This prevents the AI from attempting operations that require user interaction when running in automated environments. Choose TUI mode if your workflow needs tools that modify files or run commands.
</Info>

### Available Slash Commands

Common slash commands available in CLI:

- `/clear` - Clear the chat history
- `/compact` - Summarize chat history into a compact form
- `/config` - Switch configuration or organization
- `/exit` - Exit the chat
- `/fork` - Start a forked chat session from the current history
- `/help` - Show help message
- `/info` - Show session information
- `/init` - Create an AGENTS.md file
- `/login` - Authenticate with your account
- `/logout` - Sign out of your current session
- `/mcp` - Manage MCP server connections
- `/model` - Switch between available chat models
- `/resume` - Resume a previous chat session
- `/whoami` - Check who you're currently logged in as

<Info>Use `/help` to see all available commands.</Info>

## The Development Workflow

<Info>
  **Recommended Approach**: Start complex tasks in TUI Mode to iterate and
  refine your approach. Once you have a reliable workflow, convert it to
  Headless Mode for automation.
</Info>

### Workflow Pattern

1. **ðŸ”¬ Experiment in TUI Mode**

   - Try complex development tasks with human oversight
   - Iterate on prompts and approaches until they work reliably
   - Test edge cases and refine the agent's behavior

2. **âš¡ Automate with Continuous AI**
   - Convert proven REPL workflows to single commands
   - Deploy in CI/CD, git hooks, or scheduled tasks
   - Run with confidence knowing the approach is tested
