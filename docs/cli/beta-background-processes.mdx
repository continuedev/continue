<Warning>
  This feature is in beta and may change. Enable with the `--beta-persistent-terminal-tools` flag.
</Warning>

## Overview

Background process execution allows the Continue CLI agent to run long-running terminal commands in the background, enabling workflows where processes like dev servers need to continue while the agent performs other tasks.

## Motivation

Previously, the `Bash` tool would block until a command completed. This made it impossible for the agent to:

- Start a dev server and then take screenshots of the running application
- Launch multiple long-running processes concurrently
- Monitor ongoing processes while continuing other work

Background process execution unlocks capabilities like automated testing of live applications, parallel command execution, and better handling of persistent services.

## Enabling Background Processes

To enable this beta feature, start the CLI with the `--beta-persistent-terminal-tools` flag:

```bash
cn chat --beta-persistent-terminal-tools "help me build and test my app"
```

## Available Tools

When background processes are enabled, the following tools become available to the AI:

### Bash (Enhanced)

The existing `Bash` tool gains a new `run_in_background` parameter:

```json
{
  "command": "npm run dev",
  "run_in_background": true
}
// Returns: "Background process started with ID 1..."
```

### BashOutput

Read buffered output from a background process:

```json
{
  "bash_id": 1,
  "filter": "Local:.*http://localhost"  // Optional regex filter
}
// Returns filtered output showing server URL
```

**Parameters:**
- `bash_id` (required): The process ID to read output from
- `filter` (optional): A regex pattern to filter output lines

### ListProcesses

List all running background processes:

```json
{}
// Returns list of active processes with IDs, commands, and status
```

### KillProcess

Terminate a background process:

```json
{
  "bash_id": 1
}
// Returns confirmation of process termination
```

## Example Workflows

### Starting and Monitoring a Dev Server

```bash
cn chat --beta-persistent-terminal-tools "start the dev server and tell me when it's ready"
```

The agent can:

1. Start the server in the background
2. Poll for ready signal using `BashOutput` with a filter pattern
3. Continue with other tasks once the server is running
4. Clean up the process when done using `KillProcess`

### Running Tests Against a Live Server

```bash
cn chat --beta-persistent-terminal-tools "start the app and run e2e tests against it"
```

The agent can:

1. Start the application server in the background
2. Wait for the server to be ready using output monitoring
3. Run tests using a separate `Bash` command
4. Clean up the server process after tests complete

### Parallel Command Execution

```bash
cn chat --beta-persistent-terminal-tools "build the frontend and backend in parallel"
```

The agent can start multiple background processes simultaneously and monitor their progress.

## Technical Details

### Process Management

- **Process IDs**: Sequential numeric IDs (1, 2, 3...) for simple reference
- **Process Limit**: Maximum 10 concurrent background processes
- **Session Scope**: Processes are automatically terminated when the CLI exits

### Output Buffering

- **Buffer Size**: 10,000 lines per process
- **Circular Buffer**: Oldest lines are discarded when the buffer is full
- **Incremental Reading**: `BashOutput` returns only new output since the last read

### Lifecycle

- Exit codes are tracked and reported when processes terminate
- Automatic cleanup on CLI exit ensures no orphaned processes
- No persistence across CLI sessions

## Limitations

<Warning>
  - Processes are **session-scoped** and killed when the CLI exits
  - **No persistence** across agent sessions
  - Output buffer **limited to 10K lines** per process
  - **No built-in readiness detection** (agent must parse output)
  - Maximum **10 concurrent processes**
</Warning>
