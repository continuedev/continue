## How to use it

Agent equips the Chat model with the tools needed to handle a wide range of coding tasks, allowing the model to make decisions and save you the work of manually finding context and performing actions.

### Use Agent

You can switch to `Agent` in the mode selector below the chat input box.

<Info>
  If Agent is disabled with a `Not Supported` message, the selected model or
  provider doesn't support tools, or Continue doesn't yet support tools with it.
  See [Model Blocks](/customization/models) for more information.

### Chat with Agent

Agent lives within the same interface as [Chat](/features/chat/how-it-works), so the same [input](/features/chat/quick-start#1-start-a-conversation) is used to send messages and you can still use the same manual methods of providing context, such as [`@` context providers](/features/chat/quick-start#3-use--for-additional-context) or adding [highlighted code from the editor](/features/chat/quick-start#2-include-code-context).

#### Use natural language

With Agent, you can provide natural language instruction and let the model do the work. As an example, you might say

> Set the @typescript-eslint/naming-convention rule to "off" for all eslint configurations in this project

Agent will then decide which tools to use to get the job done.

## Give Agent permission

By default, Agent will ask permission when it wants to use a tool. Click `Continue` to allow Agent mode to proceed with the tool call or `Cancel` to reject it.

You can use tool policies to exclude or make usage automatic for specific tools. See [MCP Tools](/customization/mcp-tools) for more background.

## View Tool Responses

Any data returned from a tool call is automatically fed back into the model as a context item. Most errors are also caught and returned, so that Agent mode can decide how to proceed.
