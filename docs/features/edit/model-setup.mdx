The model you set up for Chat mode will be used for Edit mode by default.

The recommended models and how to set them up can be found [here](/features/chat/model-setup).

## Apply Model

We also recommend setting up an Apply model for the best Edit experience.

**Recommended Apply models:**

- [Morph v3](https://hub.continue.dev/morphllm/morph-v2)
- [Relace Instant Apply](https://hub.continue.dev/relace/instant-apply)

## Next Edit Model

For proactive code prediction that anticipates your next edit, Continue supports specialized [Next Edit](/features/edit/next-edit) models:

**Supported Next Edit model:**

- `mercury-coder-nextedit`: Primary model optimized for next edit prediction

Next Edit automatically activates when you have a compatible model configured for autocomplete and the appropriate access permissions.
