## How to Continue Edit

Edit is a convenient way to make quick changes to specific code and files. Select code, describe your code changes, and a diff will be streamed inline to your file which you can accept or reject.

Edit is recommended for small, targeted changes, such as

- Writing comments
- Generating unit tests
- Refactoring functions or methods

## How to Activate Edit

Highlight the block of code you would like to modify and press `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) to activate Edit mode. You can also press `Cmd/Ctrl+I` with no code highlighted, which will default to inserting code at the current cursor location.

Once you've activated Edit, you're ready to provide instructions.

### How to Provide Instructions

Describe the changes you would like the model to make to your highlighted code. For edits, a good prompt should be relatively short and concise. For longer, more complex tasks, we recommend using [Chat](/features/chat/quick-start).

### How to Accept or Reject Changes

Proposed changes appear as inline diffs within your highlighted text.

You can navigate through each proposed change, accepting or rejecting them using `Cmd+Opt+Y` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+Y` (Windows/Linux) to accept, or `Cmd+Opt+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Windows/Linux) to reject.

You can also accept or reject all changes at once using `Cmd+Shift+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to accept, or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` (Windows/Linux) to reject.

If you want to request a new suggestion for the same highlighted code section, you can use `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) to re-prompt the model.

## How to Use Edit in Jetbrains

In Jetbrains, Edit is implemented as an inline popup. See the header GIF example.
