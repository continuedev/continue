## How Chat Core Functionality Works

When you start a chat conversation, Continue:

1. **Gathers Context**: Uses any selected code sections and @-mentioned context
2. **Constructs Prompt**: Combines your input with relevant context
3. **Sends to Model**: Prompts the configured AI model for a response
4. **Streams Response**: Returns the AI response in real-time to the sidebar

## How Context Management Works

### What Context Is Automatically Included

- Selected code in your editor
- Current file context when relevant
- Previous conversation history in the session

### How to Add Manual Context

- `@Files` - Reference specific files

## How Response Handling Works

Each code section in the AI response includes action buttons:

- **Apply to current file** - Replace selected code
- **Insert at cursor** - Add code at cursor position
- **Copy** - Copy code to clipboard

## How Session Management Works

- Use `Cmd/Ctrl + L` (VS Code) or `Cmd/Ctrl + J` (JetBrains) to start a new session
- Clears all previous context for a fresh start
- Helpful for switching between different tasks

## What Advanced Features Are Available
