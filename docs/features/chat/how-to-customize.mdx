There are a number of different ways to customize Chat:

- Add a `rules` block to give the model persistent instructions through the system prompt
- Configure `@Codebase`
- Configure `@Docs`
- [Make your agent aware of codebases and documentation](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness)
- [Create a custom code RAG](/guides/custom-code-rag) (for advanced users with large codebases)
