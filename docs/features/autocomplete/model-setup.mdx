Setting up the right model for autocomplete is crucial for a smooth coding experience. Here are our top recommendations:

## Recommended Models

### Hosted-Based (Best Performance)

For the highest quality autocomplete suggestions, we recommend **[Codestral](https://hub.continue.dev/mistral/codestral)** from Mistral. This model is specifically designed for code completion and offers excellent performance across multiple programming languages.

**Quick Setup:**

1. [Add Codestral from the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/mistral/codestral)
2. Get your API key from the [Mistral Platform](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral)
3. Configure it in your Continue settings

### Local/Offline (Privacy First)

For a fully local autocomplete experience that doesn't send your code to external servers, we recommend **[Qwen 2.5 Coder 1.5B](https://hub.continue.dev/ollama/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b)** running on Ollama. This model provides good suggestions while keeping your code completely private.

**Quick Setup:**

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. [Add Qwen 2.5 Coder from the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/ollama/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b)
