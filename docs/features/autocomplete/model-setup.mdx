### Hosted (Best Speed/Quality Tradeoff)

For fast, quality autocomplete suggestions, we recommend **[Mercury Coder Small](https://hub.continue.dev/inceptionlabs/mercury-coder-small)** from Inception Labs.

### Local (Offline / Privacy First)

For a fully local autocomplete experience, we recommend **[Qwen 2.5 Coder 1.5B](https://hub.continue.dev/ollama/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b)**.

This model provides good suggestions while keeping your code completely private.
