Context Providers allow you to type '@' and see a dropdown of content that can all be provided to the model as context.

## Built-in Context Providers

You can add any built-in context-providers in your config file as shown below:

### `@File`

Reference any file in your current workspace.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: file
```

### `@Code`

Reference specific functions or classes from throughout your project.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: code
```

### `@Git Diff`

Reference all of the changes you've made to your current branch. This is useful if you want to summarize what you've done or ask for a general review of your work before committing.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: diff
```

### `@Current File`

Reference the currently open file.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: currentFile
```

### `@Terminal`

Reference the last command you ran in your IDE's terminal and its output.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: terminal
```

### `@Open`

Reference the contents of all of your open files. Set `onlyPinned` to `true` to only reference pinned files.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: open
    params:
      onlyPinned: true
```

### `@Clipboard`

Reference recent clipboard items

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: clipboard
```

### `@Tree`

Reference the structure of your current workspace.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: tree
```

### `@Problems`

Get Problems from the current file.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: problems
```

### `@Debugger`

Reference the contents of the local variables in the debugger. Currently only available in VS Code.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: debugger
    params:
      stackDepth: 3
```

Uses the top _n_ levels (defaulting to 3) of the call stack for that thread.

### `@Repository Map`

Reference the outline of your codebase. By default, signatures are included along with file in the repo map.

`includeSignatures` params can be set to false to exclude signatures. This could be necessary for large codebases and/or to reduce context size significantly. Signatures will not be included if indexing is disabled.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: repo-map
    params:
      includeSignatures: false # default true
```

Provides a list of files and the call signatures of top-level classes, functions, and methods in those files. This helps the model better understand how a particular piece of code relates to the rest of the codebase.

In the submenu that appears, you can select either `Entire codebase`, or specify a subfolder to generate the repostiory map from.

This context provider is inpsired by [Aider's repository map](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html).

### `@Operating System`

Reference the architecture and platform of your current operating system.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: os
```

### `@HTTP`

The HttpContextProvider makes a POST request to the url passed in the configuration. The server must return 200 OK with a ContextItem object or an array of ContextItems.

```yaml config.yaml
context:
  - provider: http
    params:
      url: "https://api.example.com/v1/users"
      headers:
        - Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
```

The receiving URL should expect to receive the following parameters:

POST parameters

```json
{  query: string,  fullInput: string}
```

The response 200 OK should be a JSON object with the following structure:

Response

```
[  {    "name": "",    "description": "",    "content": ""  }]// OR{  "name": "",  "description": "",  "content": ""}
```

### Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by Anthropic to unify prompts, context, and tool use. Continue supports any MCP server with the MCP context provider. Read their [quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to learn how to set up a local server and then set up your configuration like this:

```yaml config.yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: My MCP Server
    command: uvx
    args:
      - mcp-server-sqlite
      - --db-path
      - /Users/NAME/test.db
```

You'll then be able to type "@" and see "MCP" in the context providers dropdown.

## Deprecated Context Providers

<Note>
  To provide context beyond the built-in context providers, we now recommend
  using [MCP Servers](/customize/mcp-tools)
