When you use Continue, you automatically collect data on how you build software. By default, this development data is saved to `.continue/dev_data` on your local machine.

You can read more about how development data is generated as a byproduct of LLM-aided development and why we believe that you should start collecting it now: [Itâ€™s time to collect data on how you build software](https://blog.continue.dev/its-time-to-collect-data-on-how-you-build-software)

## How to Configure Custom Data Destinations

You can also configure custom destinations for your data, including remote HTTP endpoints and local file directories.

Data destinations should be configured directly in the `data` section of your `config.yaml` file. See more details about adding `data` configuration in the [YAML specification](/reference#data).

When sending development data to your own HTTP endpoint, it will receive an event JSON blob at the given `schema` version. You can view event names, schema versions, and fields [here in the source code](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/tree/main/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data).
