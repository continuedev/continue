Slash commands are shortcuts that can be activated by typing '/' in a chat session (press <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains)), and selecting from the dropdown.

Slash commands can be combined with additional instructions, including [context providers](../custom-providers) or highlighted code.

<Note>
  **Recommended approach**: Use prompt files to create slash commands instead of
  the deprecated `config.json` approach. The methods described below provide
  better flexibility and are the actively maintained ways to add custom
  commands.

## Ways to Create Slash Commands in Continue

### Assistant Prompt Blocks

The easiest way to add a slash command is by adding [`prompt` blocks](../../hub/blocks/block-types#prompts) to your assistant, which show up as slash commands in [Chat](../../features/chat/how-it-works.mdx).

### Prompt Files

It is also possible to write your own slash command by defining a “.prompt file.” Prompt files can be as simple as a text file, but also include templating so that you can refer to files, URLs, highlighted code, and more.

Learn more about prompt files [here](./prompts).

### MCP Server Prompts

Any prompts provided by [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers are also accessible in chat as Slash Commands. See the [MCP Server Deep Dive](./mcp.mdx) for more details.
