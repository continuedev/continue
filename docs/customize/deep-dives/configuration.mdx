You can easily access your agent configuration from the Continue Chat sidebar. Open the sidebar by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains) and click the Agent selector above the main chat input. Then, you can hover over an agent and click the `new window` (hub agents) or `gear` (local agents) icon.

## How to Manage Hub Agents

Hub Agents can be managed in [the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev). See [Editing an Agent](../../hub/agents/edit-an-agent.md)

## How to Configure Local Agents with YAML

Local user-level configuration is stored and can be edited in your home directory in `config.yaml`:

- `~/.continue/config.yaml` (MacOS / Linux)
- `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.yaml` (Windows)

To open this `config.yaml`, you need to open the agents dropdown in the top-right portion of the chat input. On that dropdown beside the "Local Agent" option, select the cog icon. It will open the local `config.yaml`.

When editing this file, you can see the available options suggested as you type, or check the reference below. When you save a config file from the IDE, Continue will automatically refresh to take into account your changes. A config file is automatically created the first time you use Continue, and always automatically generated with default values if it doesn't exist.

See the full reference for `config.yaml` [here](/reference).

## Legacy Configuration Methods (Deprecated)

<Info>
  View the migration guide from `config.json` to YAML [here](../yaml-migration).
</Info>

- [`config.json`](/reference) — The original configuration format, stored in the same location as `config.yaml`.
- [`.continuerc.json`](#how-to-use-continuercjson-for-workspace-configuration) — Workspace-level configuration.

⚠️ **Note:**  
`config.ts` (TypeScript configuration) was deprecated in 2024 and fully removed in 2025.  
If a `config.ts` file is detected, Continue will now fail fast and instruct you to migrate to `config.yaml` or `config.json`.

### How to Use `.continuerc.json` for Workspace Configuration

The format of `.continuerc.json` is the same as `config.json`, plus one _additional_ property `mergeBehavior`, which can be set to either `"merge"` or `"overwrite"`.

If set to `"merge"` (the default), `.continuerc.json` will be applied on top of `config.json` (arrays and objects are merged). If set to `"overwrite"`, then every top-level property of `.continuerc.json` will overwrite that property from `config.json`.

Example:

```json title=".continuerc.json"
{
  "tabAutocompleteOptions": {
    "disable": true
  },
  "mergeBehavior": "overwrite"
}
```
