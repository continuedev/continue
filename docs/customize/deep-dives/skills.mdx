Skills provide specialized instructions to the model for [Agent mode](../../ide-extensions/agent/quick-start), [Chat](../../ide-extensions/chat/quick-start), and [Edit](../../ide-extensions/edit/quick-start) requests. Unlike rules that are always included, skills are discovered by their description and loaded only when needed.

<Info>
Skills are inspired by [Claude's Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) and provide a way to give agents access to specialized knowledge without cluttering the system message.
</Info>

## How Skills Work in Continue

When you define skills, they appear in the system message with their name and description. The agent can then use the `read_skill` tool to load the full instructions when a task matches a skill's description.

### Two-Stage Discovery Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Discovery">
The agent sees available skills in the `<available_skills>` section of the system message, listing each skill's name and description.
</Step>

<Step title="Loading">
When a task matches a skill's description, the agent calls the `read_skill` tool with the skill name to get the full instructions.
</Step>
</Steps>

This approach keeps the system message lean while ensuring detailed instructions are available when needed.

## Quick Start: How to Create Your First Skill File

Below is a quick example of setting up a new skill file:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the directory structure">
Create a folder structure like `.continue/deployment` at the top level of your workspace.
</Step>

<Step title="Create the SKILL.md file">
Add a file called `SKILL.md` to this folder.
</Step>

<Step title="Write the skill content">
Write the following contents to `SKILL.md` and save:

```md title=".continue/deployment/SKILL.md"
---
name: Deploy to Staging
description: Instructions for deploying the application to the staging environment
license: MIT
---

# Deployment Process

## Prerequisites
- Ensure all tests pass
- Get approval from tech lead
- Check staging environment status

## Steps
1. Create a release branch from main
2. Run `npm run build:staging`
3. Deploy using `npm run deploy:staging`
4. Verify deployment at https://staging.example.com
5. Monitor logs for 10 minutes post-deployment

## Rollback
If issues arise, run `npm run rollback:staging`
```
</Step>

<Step title="Test the skill">
Ask the agent "How do I deploy to staging?" and it should discover and use your skill.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Skill File Format

Skills are defined using Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```md
---
name: Skill Name (required)
description: What this skill helps with (required)
toolName: custom_tool_name (optional, auto-generated from name)
license: License type (optional)
---

# Skill Instructions

Detailed instructions go here...
```

### Required Fields

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
The display name for the skill. This appears in the available skills list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string" required>
A concise description that helps the agent determine when to use this skill. Be specific about when this skill applies.
</ParamField>

### Optional Fields

<ParamField path="toolName" type="string">
Custom name for the tool. If not provided, it's auto-generated from the skill name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="license" type="string">
License information for the skill (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0).
</ParamField>

## Organizing Skills

### File Structure

Skills can be organized in subdirectories within `.continue/`:

```
.continue/
├── deployment/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Deployment procedures
├── testing/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Testing guidelines
├── onboarding/
│   └── SKILL.md          # New developer setup
└── architecture/
    └── SKILL.md          # Architecture decisions
```

Each subdirectory can contain one `SKILL.md` file. The directory name helps organize related skills logically.

### Global vs Workspace Skills

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="Workspace Skills" icon="folder">
- **Location**: `.continue/*/SKILL.md` in your project
- **Scope**: Project-specific instructions
- **Version Control**: Committed with your code
- **Use Case**: Deployment, testing, project architecture
</Card>

<Card title="Global Skills" icon="globe">
- **Location**: `~/.continue/*/SKILL.md` in your home directory
- **Scope**: Personal or organization-wide instructions
- **Version Control**: Not in project repo
- **Use Case**: General development workflows, company standards
</Card>
</Columns>

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Skill Descriptions

<CodeGroup>
```md Good
---
name: Deploy to Production
description: Instructions for deploying the application to production, including pre-deployment checks, deployment steps, and rollback procedures
---
```

```md Bad
---
name: Deployment
description: How to deploy
---
```
</CodeGroup>

**Good descriptions:**
- Are specific about what the skill covers
- Mention key actions or scenarios (e.g., "including rollback procedures")
- Help the agent decide when to use the skill

**Bad descriptions:**
- Are too generic
- Don't provide enough context
- Make it hard for the agent to know when to apply

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Appearing

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Check file location">
Ensure your `SKILL.md` files are in subdirectories of `.continue/`:
- ✅ `.continue/deployment/SKILL.md`
- ❌ `.continue/SKILL.md` (no subdirectory)
- ❌ `.continue/deployment/skill.md` (wrong case)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify YAML frontmatter">
Ensure your frontmatter is valid:
```md
---
name: My Skill
description: What it does
---
```

The `---` delimiters are required on separate lines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reload Continue">
After creating or modifying skills, reload the Continue extension:
- VS Code: Reload window (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Reload Window")
- JetBrains: Restart the IDE
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Agent Not Using Skills

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Check skill description">
Make sure your description clearly indicates when to use the skill. The agent uses this to determine relevance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model compatibility">
Ensure you're using a model with tool support. Skills use the `read_skill` tool, which requires models that support function calling.

See [tool support documentation](/customize/deep-dives/model-capabilities#tool-support) for compatible models.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Explicitly reference the skill">
Try mentioning the skill in your prompt:
- "Use the Deploy to Staging skill to help me deploy"
- "Following the code review guidelines skill, review this PR"
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Error: "Skill not found"

If the agent tries to read a skill that doesn't exist:

1. **Check the skill name**: Ensure the name in your frontmatter matches what the agent is requesting
2. **Verify file location**: Confirm the `SKILL.md` file is in the correct location
3. **Reload Continue**: The skill may not have been loaded yet

## Skills vs Rules

Understanding when to use skills vs rules:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Use Skills For" icon="book-open">
- Task-specific instructions
- Step-by-step procedures
- Detailed workflows
- Information loaded on-demand
- Context that's only needed sometimes
</Card>

<Card title="Use Rules For" icon="shield-check">
- Always-applicable guidelines
- Code quality standards
- Security requirements
- Formatting preferences
- Constraints that apply to all code
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Comparison

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Skill (On-Demand)">
```md title=".continue/deployment/SKILL.md"
---
name: Deploy to Production
description: Step-by-step instructions for deploying to production
---

1. Run tests
2. Build application
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for issues
```

**When to use**: Only loaded when the agent needs deployment instructions.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Rule (Always Applied)">
```md title=".continue/rules/code-quality.md"
---
name: Code Quality Standards
alwaysApply: true
---

- Always write tests for new features
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint rules
```

**When to use**: Applied to all agent interactions for consistent code quality.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced: Skill Licensing

If you're sharing skills or using skills from others, you can specify licensing:

```md
---
name: My Skill
description: What it does
license: MIT
---
```

This helps track the provenance and usage rights of skills, especially when skills are shared across teams or published publicly.
