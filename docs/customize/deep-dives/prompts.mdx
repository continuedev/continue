Prompts are reusable instructions that can be referenced at any time during chat. They are especially useful as context for repetitive and/or complex tasks.

<Info>
  Prompts were previously defined in a `.prompt` file format, but for
  consistency we now recommend using the same Markdown format as
  [rules](./rules) and adding `alwaysApply: false` to the frontmatter so
  that they are manually triggered.

## Quick Start: How to Create Your First Prompt File

Below is a quick example of setting up a prompt file:

1. Create a folder called `.continue/rules` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `review-prompt.md` to this folder.
3. Write the following contents to `review-prompt.md` and save.

```md title="review-prompt.md"
---
name: Redux best practices review
alwaysApply: false
---

Review the currently open file for adherence to Redux best practices, as explained in their style guide at https://redux.js.org/style-guide/.
```

Now to use this prompt, you can open Chat, type <kbd>/</kbd>, select the prompt, and type out any additional instructions you'd like to add.
