Prompts are included as user messages and are especially useful as instructions for repetitive and/or complex tasks.

## Slash Commands

By setting `invokable` to `true`, you make the markdown file a prompt, which will be available when you type <kbd>/</kbd> in Chat, Plan, and Agent mode.

```md title="explain-invokable.md"
---
name: Explain invokable
description: Explains what happens when you set invokable to true
invokable: true
---

Explain that when `invokable` is set to `true`, a slash command becomes available in the IDE extensions and CLI
```

These slash commands can be combined with other instructions, including highlighted code, to provide additional context.

## Example: `Create Supabase functions` prompt

Here is a prompt that generates high-quality PostgreSQL functions that adhere to best practices:

```md title="supabase-create-functions.md"

# Database: Create functions

You're a Supabase Postgres expert in writing database functions. Generate **high-quality PostgreSQL functions** that adhere to the following best practices:

## General Guidelines

1. **Default to `SECURITY INVOKER`:**

   - Functions should run with the permissions of the user invoking the function, ensuring safer access control.
   - Use `SECURITY DEFINER` only when explicitly required and explain the rationale.

2. **Set the `search_path` Configuration Parameter:**

   - Always set `search_path` to an empty string (`set search_path = '';`).
   - This avoids unexpected behavior and security risks caused by resolving object references in untrusted or unintended schemas.
   - Use fully qualified names (e.g., `schema_name.table_name`) for all database objects referenced within the function.

3. **Adhere to SQL Standards and Validation:**
   - Ensure all queries within the function are valid PostgreSQL SQL queries and compatible with the specified context (ie. Supabase).

<Info>You can read the rest of the `Create Supabase functions` prompt [here](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)</Info>

If you are using a local `config.yaml`, you can add it to your config like this:

```md title="config.yaml"
...

prompts:
  - uses: supabase/create-functions

...
```

If you are using Continue Mission Control, you can add it to your config by selecting "Use Rule" [here](https://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)

To use this prompt, you can open Chat / Agent / Edit, type <kbd>/</kbd>, select the prompt, and type out any additional instructions you'd like to add.

## Using a prompt with `cn (TUI mode)`

You can run this command to start [cn](../../guides/cli) with the [Create Supabase functions](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions) prompt.

```
cn --prompt supabase/create-functions "I need a function that checks for the health status"
```
Alternatively, you can start [cn](../../guides/cli) and then type <kbd>/</kbd> to manually invoke the prompt yourself.

## Using a prompt to kick off a Continuous AI workflow with `cn (Headless mode)

You can kick off Continuous AI workflows using a prompt with [cn](../../guides/cli) by adding the `-p` flag.

For example, say you are building a SaaS application and must repeatedly create custom Supabase validation functions for each new feature that accepts user input. 

These functions require you to interpret business requirements, implement complex cross-table logic (like checking user permissions, tier limits, and time-based restrictions), and make judgment calls about edge cases. 

Each function is unique enough that it can't be templated or scripted. This is where kicking off a Continuous AI workflow to get you started can be quite helpful.

Here is a command that you could run whenever you have a new feature:

```
 cn -p --prompt supabase/create-functions "I need a function for the new feature on my current branch similar to my existing database functions"
```

<Info>You can see the entire `Create Supabase functions` prompt [here](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)</Info>

When you run this workflow, [cn](../../guides/cli) will checkout your current branch, explore the new and existing code, and then draft a function for you.

You will then be able to review the implementation and improve it before you merge the new feature.
