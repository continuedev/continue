Continue needs to know what features your models support to provide the best experience. This guide explains how model capabilities work and how to configure them.

## What Are Model Capabilities?

Model capabilities tell Continue what features a model supports:

- **`tool_use`** - Whether the model can use tools and functions
- **`image_input`** - Whether the model can process images

Without proper capability configuration, you may encounter issues like:

- Agent mode being unavailable (requires tools)
- Tools not working at all
- Image uploads being disabled

## How Continue Detects Model Capabilities

Continue uses a two-tier system for determining model capabilities:

### How Automatic Detection Works (Default)

Continue automatically detects capabilities based on your provider and model name. For example:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo models support tools
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5+ models support both tools and images
- **Ollama**: Most models support tools, vision models support images
- **Google**: All Gemini models support function calling

This works well for popular models, but may not cover custom deployments or newer models.

For implementation details, see:

- [toolSupport.ts](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/toolSupport.ts) - Tool capability detection logic
- [@continuedev/llm-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@continuedev/llm-info) - Image support detection

### How to Configure Capabilities Manually

You can add capabilities to models that Continue doesn't automatically detect in your `config.yaml`.

<Note>
You cannot override autodetection - you can only add capabilities. Continue will always use its built-in knowledge about your model in addition to any capabilities you specify.
</Note>

```yaml
models:
  - name: my-custom-gpt4
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://my-deployment.com/v1
    model: gpt-4-custom
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## When to Add Capabilities Manually

Add capabilities when:

1. **Using custom deployments** - Your API endpoint serves a model with different capabilities than the standard version
2. **Using newer models** - Continue doesn't yet recognize a newly released model
3. **Experiencing issues** - Autodetection isn't working correctly for your setup
4. **Using proxy services** - Some proxy services modify model capabilities

## How to Configure Model Capabilities (Examples)

### How to Add Basic Tool Support

Add tool support for a model that Continue doesn't recognize:

```yaml
models:
  - name: custom-model
    provider: openai
    model: my-fine-tuned-gpt4
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

<Info>
  The `tool_use` capability is for native tool/function calling support. The
  model must actually support tools for this to work.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Experimental**: System message tools are available as an experimental feature
  for models without native tool support. These are not automatically used as a
  fallback and must be explicitly configured. Most models are trained for native
  tools, so system message tools may not work as well.
</Warning>

### How to Handle Models with Limited Capabilities

Explicitly set no capabilities (autodetection will still apply):

```yaml
models:
  - name: limited-claude
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-4.0-sonnet
    capabilities: [] # Empty array doesn't disable autodetection
```

<Warning>
  An empty capabilities array does not disable autodetection. Continue will
  still detect and use the model's actual capabilities. To truly limit a model's
  capabilities, you would need to use a model that doesn't support those
  features.
</Warning>

### How to Enable Multiple Capabilities

Enable both tools and image support:

```yaml
models:
  - name: multimodal-gpt
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4-vision-preview
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## Common Configuration Scenarios

Some providers and custom deployments may require explicit capability configuration:

- **OpenRouter**: May not preserve the original model's capabilities
- **Custom API endpoints**: May have different capabilities than standard models
- **Local models**: May need explicit capabilities if using non-standard model names

Example configuration:

```yaml
models:
  - name: custom-deployment
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://custom-api.company.com/v1
    model: custom-gpt
    capabilities:
      - tool_use # If supports function calling
      - image_input # If supports vision
```

## How to Troubleshoot Capability Issues

For troubleshooting capability-related issues like Agent mode being unavailable or tools not working, see the [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting#agent-mode-is-unavailable-or-tools-arent-working).

## Best Practices for Model Capabilities

1. **Start with autodetection** - Only override if you experience issues
2. **Test after changes** - Verify tools and images work as expected
3. **Keep Continue updated** - Newer versions improve autodetection

Remember: Setting capabilities only adds to autodetection. Continue will still use its built-in knowledge about your model in addition to your specified capabilities.
