Continue needs to know what features your models support to provide the best experience. This guide explains how model capabilities work and how to configure them.

## What are Model Capabilities?

Model capabilities tell Continue what features a model supports:

- **`tool_use`** - Whether the model can use tools and functions (required for Agent mode)
- **`image_input`** - Whether the model can process images

Without proper capability configuration, you may encounter issues like:

- Agent mode being unavailable
- Tools not working as expected
- Image uploads being disabled

## How Continue Detects Capabilities

Continue uses a two-tier system for determining model capabilities:

### 1. Automatic Detection (Default)

Continue automatically detects capabilities based on your provider and model name. For example:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 models have tool support, GPT-3.5 doesn't
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5+ models support both tools and images
- **Ollama**: Most models support tools, vision models support images
- **Google**: All Gemini models support function calling

This works well for popular models, but may not cover custom deployments or newer models.

### 2. Manual Override

You can explicitly set capabilities in your `config.yaml` to override autodetection:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my-custom-gpt4
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://my-deployment.com/v1
    model: gpt-4-custom
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## When to Override Capabilities

Override autodetection when:

1. **Using custom deployments** - Your API endpoint serves a model with different capabilities than the standard version
2. **Using newer models** - Continue doesn't yet recognize a newly released model
3. **Experiencing issues** - Autodetection isn't working correctly for your setup
4. **Using proxy services** - Some proxy services modify model capabilities

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Override

Force tool support for a model that Continue doesn't recognize:

```yaml
models:
  - name: custom-model
    provider: openai
    model: my-fine-tuned-gpt4
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

### Disable Capabilities

Remove capabilities that aren't working properly:

```yaml
models:
  - name: limited-claude
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-4.0-sonnet
    capabilities: [] # Disable all capabilities
```

### Multiple Capabilities

Enable both tools and image support:

```yaml
models:
  - name: multimodal-gpt
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4-vision-preview
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## Provider-Specific Notes

### OpenRouter

OpenRouter models often require capability overrides because the proxy may not preserve the original model's capabilities:

```yaml
models:
  - name: openrouter-claude
    provider: openrouter
    model: anthropic/claude-4.0-sonnet
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

### Ollama

Local Ollama models may need explicit capabilities if the model name doesn't match standard patterns:

```yaml
models:
  - name: local-llama
    provider: ollama
    model: my-custom-llama
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

### Custom API Endpoints

When using custom API endpoints that implement OpenAI-compatible interfaces:

```yaml
models:
  - name: company-llm
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://internal-api.company.com/v1
    model: company-gpt
    capabilities:
      - tool_use # Add if your endpoint supports function calling
```

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting capability-related issues like Agent mode being unavailable or tools not working, see the [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting#agent-mode-is-unavailable-or-tools-arent-working).

## Migration from config.json

For information on migrating capabilities from config.json to config.yaml format, see the [YAML Migration guide](/reference/yaml-migration).

## Best Practices

1. **Start with autodetection** - Only override if you experience issues
2. **Test after changes** - Verify tools and images work as expected
3. **Document custom models** - Note why capabilities were overridden
4. **Keep Continue updated** - Newer versions improve autodetection

Remember: The capabilities field completely overrides autodetection. If you set it, Continue won't check its built-in knowledge about your model.

## Model Compatibility Matrix

This matrix shows which popular models support various Continue features. Continue auto-detects these capabilities, but you can override them if needed.
