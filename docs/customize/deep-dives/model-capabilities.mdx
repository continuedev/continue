Continue needs to know what features your models support to provide the best experience. This guide explains how model capabilities work and how to configure them.

## What are Model Capabilities?

Model capabilities tell Continue what features a model supports:

- **`tool_use`** - Whether the model can use tools and functions (required for Agent mode)
- **`image_input`** - Whether the model can process images

Without proper capability configuration, you may encounter issues like:

- Agent mode being unavailable
- Tools not working as expected
- Image uploads being disabled

## How Continue Detects Capabilities

Continue uses a two-tier system for determining model capabilities:

### 1. Automatic Detection (Default)

Continue automatically detects capabilities based on your provider and model name. For example:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 models have tool support, GPT-3.5 doesn't
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5+ models support both tools and images
- **Ollama**: Most models support tools, vision models support images
- **Google**: All Gemini models support function calling

This works well for popular models, but may not cover custom deployments or newer models.

### 2. Manual Override

You can explicitly set capabilities in your `config.yaml` to override autodetection:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my-custom-gpt4
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://my-deployment.com/v1
    model: gpt-4-custom
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## When to Override Capabilities

Override autodetection when:

1. **Using custom deployments** - Your API endpoint serves a model with different capabilities than the standard version
2. **Using newer models** - Continue doesn't yet recognize a newly released model
3. **Experiencing issues** - Autodetection isn't working correctly for your setup
4. **Using proxy services** - Some proxy services modify model capabilities

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Override

Force tool support for a model that Continue doesn't recognize:

```yaml
models:
  - name: custom-model
    provider: openai
    model: my-fine-tuned-gpt4
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

### Disable Capabilities

Remove capabilities that aren't working properly:

```yaml
models:
  - name: limited-claude
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
    capabilities: [] # Disable all capabilities
```

### Multiple Capabilities

Enable both tools and image support:

```yaml
models:
  - name: multimodal-gpt
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4-vision-preview
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## Provider-Specific Notes

### OpenRouter

OpenRouter models often require capability overrides because the proxy may not preserve the original model's capabilities:

```yaml
models:
  - name: openrouter-claude
    provider: openrouter
    model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

### Ollama

Local Ollama models may need explicit capabilities if the model name doesn't match standard patterns:

```yaml
models:
  - name: local-llama
    provider: ollama
    model: my-custom-llama
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

### Custom API Endpoints

When using custom API endpoints that implement OpenAI-compatible interfaces:

```yaml
models:
  - name: company-llm
    provider: openai
    apiBase: https://internal-api.company.com/v1
    model: company-gpt
    capabilities:
      - tool_use # Add if your endpoint supports function calling
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Mode Unavailable

If Agent mode is grayed out:

1. Check if your model has `tool_use` capability
2. Try adding `capabilities: ["tool_use"]` to your model config
3. Verify your provider supports function calling

### Tools Not Working

If tools aren't being called:

1. Ensure `tool_use` is in your capabilities
2. Check that your API endpoint actually supports function calling
3. Some providers may use different function calling formats

### Images Not Uploading

If you can't upload images:

1. Add `image_input` to capabilities
2. Ensure your model actually supports vision (e.g., gpt-4-vision, claude-3)
3. Check that your provider passes through image data

### Verifying Current Capabilities

To see what capabilities Continue detected for your model:

1. Check the mode selector tooltips - they indicate if tools are available
2. Try uploading an image - if disabled, the model lacks `image_input`
3. Check if Agent mode is available - requires `tool_use`

## Migration from config.json

If migrating from `config.json`, the format changes:

```json
// Old config.json format
{
  "models": [
    {
      "capabilities": {
        "tools": true,
        "uploadImage": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```yaml
# New config.yaml format
models:
  - capabilities:
      - tool_use
      - image_input
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with autodetection** - Only override if you experience issues
2. **Test after changes** - Verify tools and images work as expected
3. **Document custom models** - Note why capabilities were overridden
4. **Keep Continue updated** - Newer versions improve autodetection

Remember: The capabilities field completely overrides autodetection. If you set it, Continue won't check its built-in knowledge about your model.

## Model Compatibility Matrix

This matrix shows which popular models support various Continue features. Continue auto-detects these capabilities, but you can override them if needed.
