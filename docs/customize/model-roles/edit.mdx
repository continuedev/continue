It's often useful to select a different model to respond to Edit instructions than for Chat instructions, as Edits are often more code-specific and may require less conversational readability.

In Continue, you can add `edit` to a model's roles to specify that it can be used for Edit requests. If no edit models are specified, the selected `chat` model is used.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
name: My Config
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1

models:
  - name: Claude 4 Sonnet
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
    apiKey: <YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>
    roles:
      - edit
```

Explore edit models in [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=edit). Generally, our recommendations for Edit overlap with recommendations for Chat.

## Model Recommendations

<ModelRecommendations role="chat_edit" />

## Prompt templating

You can customize the prompt template used for editing code by setting the `promptTemplates.edit` property in your model configuration. Continue uses [Handlebars syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) for templating.

Available variables for the edit template:

- `{{{userInput}}}` - The user's edit request/instruction
- `{{{language}}}` - The programming language of the code
- `{{{codeToEdit}}}` - The code that's being edited
- `{{{prefix}}}` - Content before the edit area
- `{{{suffix}}}` - Content after the edit area
- `{{{supportsCompletions}}}` - Whether the model supports completions API
- `{{{supportsPrefill}}}` - Whether the model supports prefill capability

Example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: My Custom Edit Template
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    promptTemplates:
      edit: |
        `Here is the code before editing:
        \`\`\`{{{language}}}
        {{{codeToEdit}}}
        \`\`\`

        Here is the edit requested:
        "{{{userInput}}}"

        Here is the code after editing:`
```
