Models in Continue can be configured to be used for various roles in the extension.

- [`chat`](./chat.mdx): Used for chat conversations in the extension sidebar
- [`autocomplete`](./autocomplete): Used for autocomplete code suggestions in the editor
- [`edit`](./edit.mdx): Used to generate code based on edit prompts
- [`apply`](./apply.mdx): Used to decide how to apply edits to a file
- [`embed`](./embeddings.mdx): Used to generate embeddings used for vector search (@Codebase and @Docs context providers)
- [`rerank`](./reranking.mdx): Used to rerank results from vector search

These roles can be specified for a `config.yaml` model block using `roles`. See the [YAML Specification](/reference#models) for more details.

<Info>
  For recommendations on which models work best for each role, see our [comprehensive model recommendations](/customize/models#recommended-models).

## Selecting model roles

You can control which of the models in your config for a given role will be currently used for that role. Above the main input, click the 3 dots and then the cube icon to expand the `Models` section. Then you can use the dropdowns to select an active model for each role.

<Info>
  `roles` are not explicitly defined within `config.json` (deprecated) - they
  are infered by the top level keys like `embeddingsProvider`
