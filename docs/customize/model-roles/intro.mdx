These roles can be specified for a `config.yaml` model block using `roles`. See the [YAML Specification](/reference#models) for more details.

## Selecting model roles

You can control which of the models in your config for a given role will be currently used for that role. Above the main input, click the 3 dots and then the cube icon to expand the `Models` section. Then you can use the dropdowns to select an active model for each role.

<Note>
  ### INFO

`roles` are not explicitly defined within `config.json` (deprecated) - they are infered by the top level keys like `embeddingsProvider`
