## Overview

The open-source Continue Extensions collect and report **anonymous** usage information to help us improve our product. This data enables us to understand user interactions and optimize the user experience effectively. You can opt out of telemetry collection at any time if you prefer not to share your usage information.

We utilize [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), an open-source platform for product analytics, to gather and store this data. For transparency, you can review the implementation code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/gui/src/hooks/CustomPostHogProvider.tsx) or read our [official privacy policy](https://continue.dev/privacy).

## Tracking Policy

All data collected by the open-source Continue extensions is anonymized and stripped of personally identifiable information (PII) before being sent to PostHog. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your data.

## What We Track

The following usage information is collected and reported:

- **Suggestion Interactions:** Whether you accept or reject suggestions (excluding the actual code or prompts involved).
- **Model and Command Information:** The name of the model and command used.
- **Token Metrics:** The number of tokens generated.
- **System Information:** The name of your operating system (OS) and integrated development environment (IDE).
- **Pageviews:** General pageview statistics.

## How to Opt Out

### IDE extensions

You can disable anonymous telemetry by toggling "Allow Anonymous Telemetry" off in the user settings.

#### VS Code

Alternatively in VS Code, you can disable telemetry through your VS Code settings by unchecking the "Continue: Telemetry Enabled" box (this will override the Settings Page settings). VS Code settings can be accessed with `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `,` on Windows/Linux or `cmd` + `,` on macOS).

### CLI

For `cn`, the Continue CLI, set the environment variable `CONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` before running commands:

```bash
export CONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0
cn <your prompt>
```

Or run it inline:

```bash
CONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 cn <your prompt>
```
