---

The nCompass Technologies API exposes an extremely fast inference engine for open-source language models. You can sign up [here](https://app.ncompass.tech/api-settings), copy your API key on the initial welcome screen, and then hit the play button on any model from the [nCompass Models list](https://ncompass.tech/models). Change `~/.continue/config.json` to look like this:

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="YAML">
   ```yaml title="Package or config.yaml"
   models:
     - name: Ncompass Gemma 3 Coder
       provider: ncompass
       model: google/gemma-3-27b-it
       apiKey: <YOUR_NCOMPASS_API_KEY>
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="JSON">
	```json title="config.json"
	{
      "models": [
        {
          "title": "Ncompass Gemma 3 Coder",
          "provider": "ncompass",
          "model": "google/gemma-3-27b-it",
          "apiKey": "<YOUR_NCOMPASS_API_KEY>"
        }
      ]
	}
    ```
   </Tab>
</Tabs>
