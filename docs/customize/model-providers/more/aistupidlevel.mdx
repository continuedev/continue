## What is AIStupidLevel?

AIStupidLevel is a smart AI router that continuously benchmarks 25+ AI models across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and more) and automatically routes your requests to the best-performing model based on:

- **Real-time performance data** from hourly speed tests and daily deep reasoning benchmarks
- **7-axis scoring methodology** (Correctness, Spec Compliance, Code Quality, Efficiency, Stability, Refusal Rate, Recovery)
- **Statistical degradation detection** to avoid poorly performing models
- **Cost optimization** with automatic provider switching
- **Intelligent routing strategies** for different use cases

Instead of manually choosing between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or other models, AIStupidLevel automatically selects the optimal model for your task.

## Configuration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  models:
    - name: AIStupidLevel Auto Coding
      provider: aistupidlevel
      model: auto-coding
      apiKey: <YOUR_AISTUPIDLEVEL_API_KEY>
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JSON (Deprecated)">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "models": [
      {
        "title": "AIStupidLevel Auto Coding",
        "provider": "aistupidlevel",
        "model": "auto-coding",
        "apiKey": "<YOUR_AISTUPIDLEVEL_API_KEY>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  </Tab>

## Available Routing Strategies

AIStupidLevel offers different "auto" models that optimize for specific use cases:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `auto` | Best overall performance across all metrics | General-purpose tasks |
| `auto-coding` | Optimized for code generation and quality | Software development, debugging |
| `auto-reasoning` | Best for complex reasoning and problem-solving | Deep analysis, mathematical problems |
| `auto-creative` | Optimized for creative writing quality | Content creation, storytelling |
| `auto-cheapest` | Most cost-effective option | High-volume, budget-conscious tasks |
| `auto-fastest` | Fastest response time | Real-time applications, quick queries |

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** at [aistupidlevel.info](https://aistupidlevel.info) and navigate to the Router section
2. **Add your provider API keys** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, etc.) to your AIStupidLevel dashboard
3. **Generate a router API key** that Continue will use
4. **Configure Continue** with your AIStupidLevel API key
5. **Make requests** - AIStupidLevel automatically routes to the best model based on real-time performance

When you make a request, AIStupidLevel:
- Analyzes current model performance from continuous benchmarks
- Selects the optimal model based on your chosen strategy
- Routes your request using your configured provider API keys
- Returns the response with metadata about which model was selected

## Key Features

- **Degradation Protection**: Automatically avoids models experiencing performance issues
- **Cost Optimization**: Routes to cheaper models when performance is comparable
- **Provider Diversity**: Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, and more through one API
- **Transparent Routing**: Response headers show which model was selected and why
- **Performance Tracking**: Dashboard shows your usage, cost savings, and routing decisions
- **Enterprise SLA**: 99.9% uptime guarantee with multi-region deployment

## Response Headers

AIStupidLevel includes custom headers in responses to show routing decisions:

```
X-AISM-Provider: anthropic
X-AISM-Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
X-AISM-Reasoning: Selected claude-sonnet-4-20250514 from anthropic for best coding capabilities (score: 42.3). Ranked #1 of 12 available models. Last updated 2h ago.
```

## Pricing

AIStupidLevel charges only for the underlying model usage (at cost) plus a small routing fee. You can monitor costs in real-time through the dashboard.
