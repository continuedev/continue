Replicate is a great option for newly released language models or models that you've deployed through their platform. Sign up for an account [here](https://replicate.ai/), copy your API key, and then select any model from the [Replicate Streaming List](https://replicate.com/collections/streaming-language-models). Change `~/.continue/config.json` to look like this:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  name: My Config
  version: 0.0.1
  schema: v1

  models:
    - name: Replicate CodeLLama
      provider: replicate
      model: codellama-13b
      apiKey: <YOUR_REPLICATE_API_KEY>
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JSON">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "models": [
      {
        "title": "Replicate CodeLLama",
        "provider": "replicate",
        "model": "codellama-13b",
        "apiKey": "<YOUR_REPLICATE_API_KEY>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you don't specify the `model` parameter, it will default to `replicate/llama-2-70b-chat:58d078176e02c219e11eb4da5a02a7830a283b14cf8f94537af893ccff5ee781`.
