<Info>
  To get an Ask Sage API key login to the Ask Sage platform (If you don't have
  an account, you can create one [here](https://chat.asksage.ai/)) and follow
  the instructions in the Ask Sage Docs: [Ask Sage API
  Key](https://docs.asksage.ai/docs/api-documentation/api-documentation.html)
</Info>

## Configuration

To use the Ask Sage models, you can use the following

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  models:
    - name: GPT-4 gov
      provider: askSage
      model: gpt4-gov
      apiBase: https://api.asksage.ai/server/
      apiKey: <YOUR_ASK_SAGE_API_KEY>
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JSON">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "models": [
      {
        "title": "GPT-4 gov",
        "provider": "askSage",
        "model": "gpt4-gov",
        "apiBase": "https://api.asksage.ai/server/",
        "apiKey": "<YOUR_ASK_SAGE_API_KEY>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `apiBase` will be listed on the Ask Sage platform when you generate an `API key`. You will see context as shown below:

> Server API for query/training etc.:
>
> - Documentation: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NICOLASCHAILLAN_1/server_ask-sage_api/1.0
> - URL for this API is: https://api.asksage.ai/server/

## Usage

Currently, the setup for the models provided by Ask Sage is to support the following two functionalities provided by Continue.Dev:

- `Chat` to understand and iterate on code in the sidebar
- `Edit` to modify code without leaving your current file

More models, functionalities and documentation will be added in the future for Ask Sage Integration.

> We recommend to utilize the `OpenAI` or `Anthropic` models for the best performance and results for the `Chat` and `Edit` functionalities.

## Ask Sage Documentation

Ask Sage documentation is not available with Continue.Dev, so if you have any questions or need help with Ask Sage type `@ask` and select the `Ask Sage` option in the chat. Then procced to ask your question about Ask Sage.
