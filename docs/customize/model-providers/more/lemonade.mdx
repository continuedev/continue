<Info>
  Get started with [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai/) - Refreshingly fast LLMs on GPUs and NPUs with seamless Continue integration
</Info>

## Overview

Lemonade Server provides optimized local LLM inference with support for GPU and NPU hardware acceleration. It offers an OpenAI-compatible API that seamlessly integrates with Continue and other open-source platforms.

## Installation

Download and install Lemonade Server from [lemonade-server.ai](https://lemonade-server.ai/).

## Configuration

Lemonade Server is available directly in the Continue UI as a provider. You can select it from the model provider dropdown without manual configuration.

### Option 1: Using the Continue UI (Recommended)

1. Click on the model selector dropdown in Continue
2. Select "Add Model"
3. Choose "Lemonade Server" from the provider list
4. Continue will automatically configure the connection

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you need custom settings, you can manually configure Lemonade:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="YAML">
    ```yaml title="config.yaml"
    models:
      - name: Lemonade
        provider: lemonade
        model: <MODEL_NAME>
        apiBase: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JSON (Deprecated)">
    ```json title="config.json"
    {
      "models": [
        {
          "title": "Lemonade",
          "provider": "lemonade",
          "model": "<MODEL_NAME>",
          "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started

1. **Install Lemonade Server**: Download from [lemonade-server.ai](https://lemonade-server.ai/)
2. **Start the server**: Launch Lemonade Server (runs on `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/` by default)
3. **Add to Continue**: Select Lemonade Server from the model provider dropdown in Continue
4. **Load a model**: Choose your preferred model through the interface
