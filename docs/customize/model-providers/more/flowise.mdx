[Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/) is a low-code/no-code drag & drop tool with the aim to make it easy for people to visualize and build LLM apps. Continue can then be configured to use the `Flowise` LLM class, like the example here:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  name: My Config
  version: 0.0.1
  schema: v1

  models:
    - name: Flowise
      provider: flowise
      model: <MODEL>
      apiBase: <API_BASE>
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JSON">
  ```json title="config.json"
  {
    "models": [
      {
        "provider": "flowise",
        "title": "Flowise",
        "model": "<MODEL>",
        "apiBase": "<API_BASE>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
