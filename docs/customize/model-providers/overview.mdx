## How to Choose a Model Provider

When selecting a model provider, consider:

1. **Hosting preference**: Do you need local models for offline use or privacy, or are you comfortable with cloud services?
2. **Performance requirements**: Different providers offer varying levels of speed, quality, and context length.
3. **Specific capabilities**: Some models excel at code generation, others at embeddings or reasoning tasks.
4. **Pricing**: Costs vary significantly between providers, from free local options to premium cloud services.
5. **API key requirements**: Most cloud providers require API keys that you'll need to configure.

## Configuration Format

You can add models to your `config.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
models:
  - name: Claude 4 Sonnet
    provider: anthropic # Choose provider from the lists above
    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514 # Specific model name
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    roles:
      - chat
      - edit
      - apply
```
For more detailed configuration, visit the specific provider pages linked above.

## Change Your Model Provider

Continue allows you to choose your favorite or even add multiple model providers. This allows you to use different models for different tasks, or to try another model if you’re not happy with the results from your current model. Continue supports all of the popular model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft/Azure, Mistral, and more. You can even self host your own model provider if you’d like.
