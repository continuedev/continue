title: "Skills"
description: "Skills allow you to provide project-specific instructions for tasks that the AI agent can discover and use when relevant. Instead of including all instructions in the system message, skills are loaded on-demand when the agent needs them."

Think of skills as specialized knowledge that your AI agent can reference when needed:

- **Define task-specific workflows** and procedures
- **Document specialized processes** unique to your project
- **Create reusable instructions** that agents can discover contextually
- **Reduce system message clutter** by loading instructions on-demand

By implementing skills, you help the agent understand when and how to perform specialized tasks in your codebase without overwhelming the system message with all possible instructions.

## How Skills Work

Skills are discovered by the agent through their name and description in the system message. When a task matches a skill's description, the agent can read the full skill instructions using the `read_skill` tool. This two-stage approach keeps the system message concise while making detailed instructions available when needed.

## Where to Manage Skills

<Card title="Local Skills (.continue/*/SKILL.md)" icon="folder">
- Create `SKILL.md` files in any `.continue/` subdirectory
- Automatically discovered and loaded
- Edit directly in your file system
- Version controlled alongside your code
- Best for project-specific skills (e.g., "how to deploy to staging")
</Card>

<Info>
**Quick Setup**: Start by creating a `.continue/deployment/SKILL.md` file to document your deployment process, or `.continue/testing/SKILL.md` for testing guidelines.
