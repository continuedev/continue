# Continue

**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs/) is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

## Getting Started

After install is complete, the Continue extension will automatically open. You can also open it by pressing `cmd+k` on Mac / `ctrl+k` on Windows and then selecting `Continue: Open Continue GUI`.

To learn how to use it, try to use Continue for the following after `calculator.py` opens:
- "Write me a calculator class"
- Ask for a new method (e.g. "exp", "mod", "sqrt")
- Type /comment to write comments for the entire class
- Ask about how the class works, how to write it in another language, etc.

Give Continue a star on GitHub [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)
