# Continue

**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs/) is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

You can use Continue to use and create recipes that automate the most repetitive sequences of tasks in your workflows.

## Getting Started

After install is complete, the Continue extension will automatically open. You can also open it by pressing `cmd+shift+p` on Mac / `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows and then selecting `Continue: Open Continue GUI`

To test a few common recipes, open a blank python file and try the following:

- Ask "write a calculator class in python"
- /comment to write comments for the class
- /pytest to write Pytest unit tests in a separate file
- Ask in natural language for a new method

Give Continue a star on GitHub [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)
