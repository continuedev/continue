# PearAI React App

The PearAI React app is a notebook-like interface to the PearAI server. It allows the user to submit arbitrary text input, then communicates with the server to takes steps, which are displayed as a sequence of editable cells. The React app should sit beside an IDE, as in the VS Code extension.
