## Core Functionality[​](#core-functionality "Direct link to Core Functionality")

When you start a chat conversation, Continue:

1. **Gathers Context**: Uses any selected code sections and @-mentioned context
2. **Constructs Prompt**: Combines your input with relevant context
3. **Sends to Model**: Prompts the configured AI model for a response
4. **Streams Response**: Returns the AI response in real-time to the sidebar

## Context Management[​](#context-management "Direct link to Context Management")

### Automatic Context[​](#automatic-context "Direct link to Automatic Context")

- Selected code in your editor

- Previous conversation history in the session

### Manual Context[​](#manual-context "Direct link to Manual Context")

- `@Codebase` - Search and include relevant code from your project
- `@Docs` - Include documentation context
- `@Files` - Reference specific files
- Custom context providers

## Response Handling[​](#response-handling "Direct link to Response Handling")

Each code section in the AI response includes action buttons:
