## Core Functionality[​](#core-functionality "Direct link to Core Functionality")

When you start a chat conversation, Continue:

1. **Gathers Context**: Uses any selected code sections and @-mentioned context
2. **Constructs Prompt**: Combines your input with relevant context
3. **Sends to Model**: Prompts the configured AI model for a response
4. **Streams Response**: Returns the AI response in real-time to the sidebar

## Context Management[​](#context-management "Direct link to Context Management")

### Automatic Context[​](#automatic-context "Direct link to Automatic Context")

* Selected code in your editor
* Current file context when relevant
* Previous conversation history in the session

### Manual Context[​](#manual-context "Direct link to Manual Context")

* `@Codebase` - Search and include relevant code from your project
* `@Docs` - Include documentation context
* `@Files` - Reference specific files
* Custom context providers

## Response Handling[​](#response-handling "Direct link to Response Handling")

Each code section in the AI response includes action buttons:

* **Apply to current file** - Replace selected code
* **Insert at cursor** - Add code at cursor position
* **Copy** - Copy code to clipboard

## Session Management[​](#session-management "Direct link to Session Management")

* Use `Cmd/Ctrl + L` (VS Code) or `Cmd/Ctrl + J` (JetBrains) to start a new session
* Clears all previous context for a fresh start
* Helpful for switching between different tasks

## Advanced Features[​](#advanced-features "Direct link to Advanced Features")

### Prompt Inspection[​](#prompt-inspection "Direct link to Prompt Inspection")

View the exact prompt sent to the AI model in the [prompt logs](/troubleshooting) for debugging and optimization.
