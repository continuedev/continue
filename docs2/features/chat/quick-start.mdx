Chat makes it easy to ask for help from an AI without leaving your IDE. Get explanations, generate code, and iterate on solutions conversationally.

## Basic Usage[​](#basic-usage "Direct link to Basic Usage")

### 1. Start a Conversation[​](#1-start-a-conversation "Direct link to 1. Start a Conversation")

Type your question or request in the chat input and press Enter.

**Examples:**

* "Explain this function"
* "How do I handle errors in this code?"
* "Generate a test for this component"

### 2. Include Code Context[​](#2-include-code-context "Direct link to 2. Include Code Context")

Select code in your editor, then use the keyboard shortcut to include it in your chat:

* JetBrains

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + L` to send selected code to chat

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + J` to send selected code to chat

### 3. Use @ for Additional Context[​](#3-use--for-additional-context "Direct link to 3. Use @ for Additional Context")

Type `@` to include specific context:
