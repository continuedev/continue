## How to use it[​](#how-to-use-it "Direct link to How to use it")

Edit is a convenient way to make quick changes to specific code and files. Select code, describe your code changes, and a diff will be streamed inline to your file which you can accept or reject.

Edit is recommended for small, targeted changes, such as

* Writing comments
* Generating unit tests
* Refactoring functions or methods

## Highlight code and activate[​](#highlight-code-and-activate "Direct link to Highlight code and activate")

Highlight the block of code you would like to modify and press `cmd/ctrl` + `i` to active Edit mode. You can also enter Edit mode by pressing `cmd/ctrl` + `i` with no code highlighted, which will default to editing the current file.

## Describe code changes[​](#describe-code-changes "Direct link to Describe code changes")

Describe the changes you would like the model to make to your highlighted code. For edits, a good prompt should be relatively short and concise. For longer, more complex tasks, we recommend using [Chat](/features/chat/quick-start).

## Accept or reject changes[​](#accept-or-reject-changes "Direct link to Accept or reject changes")

Proposed changes appear as inline diffs within your highlighted text.

You can navigate through each proposed change, accepting or rejecting them using `cmd/ctrl` + `opt` + `y` (to accept) or `cmd/ctrl` + `opt` + `n` (to reject).

You can also accept or reject all changes at once using `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `enter` (to accept) or `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `delete/backspace` (to reject).

If you want to request a new suggestion for the same highlighted code section, you can use `cmd/ctrl` + `i` to re-prompt the model.

## VS Code[​](#vs-code "Direct link to VS Code")

In VS Code, Edit is implemented in the extension sidebar with a similar interface to [Chat](/features/chat/how-it-works), and you can also enter Edit mode by using the Mode Selector below the main Chat input to select `Edit`.

You can also reject and accept diffs using the `Reject All` and `Accept All` buttons that show up in the Chat when diffs are present (see examples below).

### Adding Code to Edit[​](#adding-code-to-edit "Direct link to Adding Code to Edit")

Along with adding highlighted code, you can also manually add files to edit using the `Add file` combobox or by clicking the dropdown and selecting `Add all open files` to add all files that are currently open in the editor.

## Jetbrains[​](#jetbrains "Direct link to Jetbrains")

In Jetbrains, Edit is implemented as an inline popup. See the header GIF example.
