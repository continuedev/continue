## Models[​](#models "Direct link to Models")

Models are blocks that let you specify Large Language Models (LLMs) and other deep learning models to be used for various roles in the open-source IDE extension like Chat, Autocomplete, Edit, Embed, Rerank, etc. You can explore available models on [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models).

Continue supports [many model providers](/customization/models#openai), including Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, Azure, xAI, DeepSeek, and more. Models can have one or more of the following roles depending on its capabilities, including `chat`, `edit`, `apply`, `autocomplete`, `embed`, and `rerank`. Read more about roles [here](/customize/model-roles). View [`models`](/reference#models) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## Context[​](#context "Direct link to Context")

Context blocks define a context provider which can be referenced in Chat with `@` to pull in data from external sources such as files and folders, a URL, Jira or Confluence, and GitHub issues, among others. [Explore context provider blocks](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/context) on the hub.

Learn more about context providers [here](/reference#context), and check out [this guide](/guides/build-your-own-context-provider) to creating your own custom context provider. The `config.yaml` spec for context can be found [`here`](/reference#context).

## Docs[​](#docs "Direct link to Docs")

Docs are blocks that point to documentation sites, which will be indexed locally and then can be referenced as context using @Docs in Chat. [Explore docs](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/docs) on the hub.

Learn more in the [@Docs deep dive](/customization/overview#documentation-context), and view [`docs`](/reference#docs) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## MCP Servers[​](#mcp-servers "Direct link to MCP Servers")

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models. MCP Servers can be defined in `mcpServers` blocks. [Explore MCP Servers](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/mcp) on the hub.

Learn more in the [MCP deep dive](/customization/mcp-tools), and view [`mcpServers`](/reference#mcpservers) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## Rules[​](#rules "Direct link to Rules")

Rules blocks are instructions that your custom AI code assistant will always keep in mind - the contents of rules are inserted into the system message for all Chat requests. [Explore rules](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/rules) on the hub.

Learn more in the [rules deep dive](/customization/rules), and view [`rules`](/reference#rules) in the YAML Reference for more details.

## Prompts[​](#prompts "Direct link to Prompts")

Prompts blocks are pre-written, reusable prompts that can be referenced at any time during chat. They are especially useful as context for repetitive and/or complex tasks. [Explore prompts](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/prompts) on the hub.

Prompt blocks have the same syntax as [prompt files](/customization/prompts). The `config.yaml` spec for `prompts` can be found [here](/reference#prompts).

## Data[​](#data "Direct link to Data")

Data blocks allow you send your development data to custom destinations of your choice. Development data can be used for a variety of purposes, including analyzing usage, gathering insights, or fine-tuning models. You can read more about development data [here](/customize/overview#development-data). Explore data block examples [here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/data).

Data destinations are configured in the [`data`](/reference#data) section of `config.yaml`.
