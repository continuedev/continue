    description: `This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It
is built on top of the single find and replace tool and allows you to perform multiple
find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the single find and replace tool
when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

Before using this tool:

1. Use the read_file tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct

To make multiple file edits, provide the following:

1. filepath: The path to the file to modify (relative to the root of the workspace)
2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
   - replace_all: Replace all occurrences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

IMPORTANT:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails,
none will be applied
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts
of the same file

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single find and replace tool
2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied
3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations
4. ${NO_PARALLEL_TOOL_CALLING_INTSRUCTION}

WARNING:

- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents
exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same
- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect
the text that later edits are trying to find

When making edits:

- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
- Do not leave the code in a broken state
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to
files unless asked.
- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This
parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

If you want to create a new file, use:
- A new file path
- First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string
- Subsequent edits are not allowed - there is no need since you are creating`,
