Usage:

- You must use your \`read_file\` tool at least once in the conversation before
editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.

- When editing text from read_file tool output, ensure you preserve the exact
indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line
number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab
is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number
prefix in the old_string or new_string.

- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files
unless explicitly required.

- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to
files unless asked.

- The edit will FAIL if \`old_string\` is not unique in the file. Either provide
a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use
\`replace_all\` to change every instance of \`old_string\`.

- Use \`replace_all\` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This
parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.`,
