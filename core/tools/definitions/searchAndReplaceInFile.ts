\`\`\`
------- SEARCH
[exact content to find]
=======
[new content to replace with]
+++++++ REPLACE
\`\`\`

Critical rules:
1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:
    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings
    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.
2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.
    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.
    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.
3. **Order matters**: DIFFs in the array should be ordered from top to bottom of the file to ensure correct application.
4. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.
5. Splitting up tool calls:
    * When making multiple closely related edits to the same file, you should try to use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in a single tool call, rather than making multiple separate tool calls
    * If you need to make follow up edits or group your work into logical segments, it is okay to perform additional tool calls
    * DO NOT make back-to-back tool calls. Instead interleave with brief explanation of what each will do. For example, instead of [explanation, tool call, tool call] you should do [explanation, tool call, explanation, tool call]
6. Special operations:
    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)
    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section
    
Usage:

[exact content to find]

[new content to replace with]
+++++++ REPLACE

------- SEARCH
[exact content to find]
=======
[new content to replace with]
+++++++ REPLACE
  \`\`\`

Each string in the diffs array can contain multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, and all will be applied sequentially in the order they appear.`,
