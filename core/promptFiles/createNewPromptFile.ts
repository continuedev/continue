Give me feedback on the above changes. For each file, you should output a markdown section including the following:
- If you found any problems, an h3 like "❌ <filename>"
- If you didn't find any problems, an h3 like "✅ <filename>"
- If you found any problems, add below a bullet point description of what you found, including a minimal code snippet explaining how to fix it
- If you didn't find any problems, you don't need to add anything else

Here is an example. The example is surrounded in backticks, but your response should not be:

\`\`\`
### ✅ <Filename1>

### ❌ <Filename2>

<Description>
\`\`\`

You should look primarily for the following types of issues, and only mention other problems if they are highly pressing.

- console.logs that have been left after debugging
- repeated code
- algorithmic errors that could fail under edge cases
- something that could be refactored

Make sure to review ALL files that were changed, do not skip any.
