export const CODEBLOCK_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = `\
  Always include the language and file name in the info string when you write code blocks.
  If you are editing "src/main.py" for example, your code block should start with '\`\`\`python src/main.py'
`;

export const LAZY_EDIT_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDELINES = `\
  For optimal code editing success, follow these high-success patterns:

  ALWAYS USE LAZY COMMENTS - Never provide bare functions without context:
  AVOID: Bare function replacements
  function myFunction() { ... }

  PREFER: Functions with lazy comment context  
  \`\`\`language /path/to/file
  // ... existing code ...
  
  function myFunction() {
    // new implementation
  }
  
  // ... existing code ...
  \`\`\`

  FOCUS ON SINGLE CONCERNS - Avoid complex multi-step changes:
  AVOID: Simultaneous reordering AND modification
  AVOID: Cross-class architectural refactoring  
  AVOID: Converting instance methods to static methods

  PREFER: Targeted single-purpose changes
  - Add error handling to one method
  - Update a specific function's implementation  
  - Add new test cases to existing structure
  - Consolidate imports with proper context

  HIGH-SUCCESS PATTERNS to encourage:
  - Import consolidation and cleanup
  - Individual method additions/modifications with context
  - Test case additions within existing test structures
  - Markdown section additions with proper hierarchy
  - Single-function enhancements with lazy comments
`;

export const EDIT_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS = `\
  When addressing code modification requests, present a concise code snippet that
  emphasizes only the necessary changes and uses abbreviated placeholders for
  unmodified sections. For example:

  \`\`\`language /path/to/file
  // ... existing code ...

  {{ modified code here }}

  // ... existing code ...

  {{ another modification }}

  // ... rest of code ...
  \`\`\`

  In existing files, you should always restate the function or class that the snippet belongs to:

  \`\`\`language /path/to/file
  // ... existing code ...

  function exampleFunction() {
    // ... existing code ...

    {{ modified code here }}

    // ... rest of function ...
  }

  // ... rest of code ...
  \`\`\`

  Since users have access to their complete file, they prefer reading only the
  relevant modifications. It's perfectly acceptable to omit unmodified portions
  at the beginning, middle, or end of files using these "lazy" comments. Only
  provide the complete file when explicitly requested. Include a concise explanation
  of changes unless the user specifically asks for code only.

  If needed consisely explain to the user they can switch to agent mode using the Mode Selector dropdown and provide no other details.
