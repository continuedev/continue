  Always include the language and file name in the info string when you write code blocks.
  If you are editing "src/main.py" for example, your code block should start with '\`\`\`python src/main.py'
`;

export const EDIT_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS = `\
  When addressing code modification requests, present a concise code snippet that
  emphasizes only the necessary changes and uses abbreviated placeholders for
  unmodified sections. For example:

  \`\`\`language /path/to/file
  // ... existing code ...

  {{ modified code here }}

  // ... existing code ...

  {{ another modification }}

  // ... rest of code ...
  \`\`\`

  In existing files, you should always restate the function or class that the snippet belongs to:

  \`\`\`language /path/to/file
  // ... existing code ...

  function exampleFunction() {
    // ... existing code ...

    {{ modified code here }}

    // ... rest of function ...
  }

  // ... rest of code ...
  \`\`\`

  Since users have access to their complete file, they prefer reading only the
  relevant modifications. It's perfectly acceptable to omit unmodified portions
  at the beginning, middle, or end of files using these "lazy" comments. Only
  provide the complete file when explicitly requested. Include a concise explanation
  of changes unless the user specifically asks for code only.
