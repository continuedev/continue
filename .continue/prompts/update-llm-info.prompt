name: Update LLM Info
description: Updates Gemini blocks with latest information
version: 2
---
I need you to update this repo with the latest information about large language models from certain providers.
The information is stored in the `packages/llm-info` directory, which operates as its own npm package.
Information is stored in a simple JSON format, with one file of models per "provider" (e.g. gemini, ollama, openai, etc).
For example, Gemini model information is stored in `packages/llm-info/src/providers/gemini.ts`.

To make these updates for a given provider, perform the following steps one at a time:

1. VIEW CURRENT INFORMATION

To view the current llm info, read the file (e.g. `packages/llm-info/src/providers/gemini.ts`) using the read_file tool.
If you do not see a tool for reading files, let me know.

For reference, here is the LLMInfo interface used to store the information:

```typescript
export interface LlmInfo {
  model: string; // the model name used to distinguish the model at the API layer, e.g. "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"
  displayName?: string; // A fitting display name, e.g. "Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview"
  description?: string; // A short description of the model, as similar as possible to descriptions found on the provider's website
  contextLength?: number; // The size of the context window in tokens, often called "max input tokens" or "context length"
  maxCompletionTokens?: number; // The maximum number of tokens the model can output
  regex?: RegExp; // A regex expression to uniquely match the model name if it had some slight modifications/upgrades, e.g. /gemini-2\.5-pro-preview/i
  mediaTypes?: MediaType[]; // Input/output types supported by the model, e.g. [MediaType.Text, MediaType.Image]
}

export enum MediaType {
  Text = "text",
  Image = "image",
  Audio = "audio",
  Video = "video",
}

export const AllMediaTypes = [
  MediaType.Text,
  MediaType.Image,
  MediaType.Audio,
  MediaType.Video,
];
```

2. EXTRACT NEW INFORMATION

Fetch information from the internet using the search web and read url tools.
If you do not see either of these tools, stop and let me know.

Retrieve the following sites per these providers, and consider these notes on how to extract the information:
- "gemini": https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models - maxCompletionTokens is called "Output token limit", contextLength is called "Input token limit"
// TODO: add info for openai, ollama, etc

For any other providers, search the web for "latest [provider] models" and find the most relevant model information using your best judgement.
Generally, ignore models that do not support text output. These models will be used in a coding agent client that only supports text/image input and text/output, so extraneous capabilities can be ignored.
Sometimes, "Experimental", "Preview", or similar versions of models are available. The latest-date version of each should have its own information maintained.

3. UPDATE THE INFORMATION

Use the edit file tool to submit updates to the relevant provider file (e.g. `packages/llm-info/src/providers/gemini.ts`).
Let me know if you do not see a tool for editing files.

Generally, avoid making changes to existing information, as it is probably up to date.
Primarily, focus on adding new models or adding missing information to existing models.
NEVER delete any existing models, but let me know if you think one should be removed.
Stop to ask me if you are unsure about any changes, and let me know if there are updates that seem nuanced, complex, or extremely notable.
Provide a summary of changes after the fact.

4. ASK IF I WANT TO PUBLISH TO NPM
After you are done updating everything, remind me that I need to publish the changes to npm.

// TODO too sensitive for now
// If yes, update `packages/llm-info/package.json` with the new version number and then
// - use the terminal tool to commit the changes
// - use the terminal tool to publish changes to npm
// If you do not see a tool for running terminal commands, let me know.

// User input
Please update LLM Info for the following providers. If "all", update all providers mentioned above:
