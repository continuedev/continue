description: This rule applies to all documentation files to ensure consistent
  SEO optimization and improve discoverability. It helps users and search
  engines understand the content of each page before reading it.

Every file in the docs folder must include a 'description' field in its frontmatter that accurately summarizes the content of the page in 100-160 characters. The description should be concise, keyword-rich, and explain what users will learn or accomplish from the page.
