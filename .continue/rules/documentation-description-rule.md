  SEO optimization and improve discoverability. It helps users and search
  engines understand the content of each page before reading it.

Every file in the docs folder must include a 'description' field in its frontmatter that accurately summarizes the content of the page in 100-160 characters. The description should be concise, keyword-rich, and explain what users will learn or accomplish from the page.
