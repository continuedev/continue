When a user asks how a certain part of the code works:

## 1. Describe what the code does in isolation

Explain the functionality of the code without considering its interactions with other parts of the codebase.

## 2. Describe interactions with other parts of the codebase

If the code interacts with other parts of the codebase, describe how the code is imported and used in other parts of the codebase.

## 3. Include parent function for clarity

When describing each use-case, include the parent function for clarity.
