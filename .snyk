# Ignoring Next.js vulnerability SNYK-JS-NEXT-9508709
# Reason: Next.js is only an optional peer dependency of iron-session in the CLI extension
# and is not actually used or installed in this project. The vulnerability requires Next.js
# to be running as a server, which doesn't apply to our use case.
