  description: `This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently.
This tool is ideal when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

To make multiple edits to a file, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace/indentation)
   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
   - replace_all: Replace all occurences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

IMPORTANT:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit, so plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations
- Edits are atomic - all edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS use the ${readFileTool.name} tool just before making edits, to understand the file's up-to-date contents and context
2. When making edits:
- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
- Do not leave the code in a broken state
- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
- Empty old_string can be used to insert content at the beginning of a file

WARNINGS:
- If earlier edits affect the text that later edits are trying to find, files can become mangled
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same - they MUST be different
- The tool will fail if you have not used the ${readFileTool.name} tool to read the file in this session
- The tool will fail if the file does not exist - it cannot create new files
- This tool cannot create new files - the file must already exist`,
