# 👋 Welcome to Continue

## 🔑 Most important shortcuts

> If you've been using Continue, these have changed. You can always customize them in VS Code settings.

<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> = Select code

<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> = Select code for follow-up

<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> = Quick edit

<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> = Automatically debug terminal

## ❗️ Before you get started

Continue is currently in the left sidebar, but we recommend moving it to the right. This way it won't cover your file explorer. You can move it back at any time.

## ⚡️ Setting up tab autocomplete

1. Download [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
2. Download starcoder:3b by running `ollama run starcoder:3b` in the terminal
3. That's it! You can disable autocomplete at any time by clicking the `Continue` button in the status bar (bottom right of the VS Code window)
