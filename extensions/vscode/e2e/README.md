# E2E Tests

## Setup

When running e2e tests for the first time

```bash
npm run e2e:all
```

## Run

Depending on what code you update, you can use a faster loop to test your changes:

- If you update the e2e test code and/or config.yaml/json, you can run `npm run e2e:quick`
- If you update the extension code, you can run `npm run e2e:recompile`
- If you update the gui code, you can run `npm run e2e:rebuild-gui`

## Writing tests

All e2e tests are separated (by folder) into

- `selectors` - functions that return elements
- `actions` - functions that perform actions on the editor
- `tests` - the actual tests, which are typically longer paths of functionality rather than individual actions

### Why are my tests failing?

- Did you place a `data-testid` on a React component instead of an actual HTML element?
- Do you have a config.yaml locally but the test is failing when running with config.json in CI?
- Is your `data-testid` or selector actually just wrong?
- Are you inconsistently getting different behaviors? You can try adding a `TestUtils.waitForTimeout` between two events if you think it's caused by a race condition. Note that this may lead to flake down the road.
- Alternatively, you can add a `TestUtils.waitForSuccess`
