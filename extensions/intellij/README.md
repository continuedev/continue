**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs) is the open-source autopilot for software development—an extension that brings the power of ChatGPT to your IDE**

### Get possible explanations

Highlight + select code sections and ask a question to get another perspective

- “how can I set up a Prisma schema that cascades deletes?”
- “where in the page should I be making this request to the backend?”
- “how can I communicate between these iframes?”

### Edit in natural language

Highlight + select a section of code and instruct Continue to refactor it

- “/edit migrate this digital ocean terraform file into one that works for GCP”
- “/edit change this plot into a bar chart in this dashboard component”
- “/edit rewrite this function to be async”

### Generate files from scratch

Open a blank file and let Continue start new Python scripts, React components, etc.

- “/edit here is a connector for postgres, now write one for kafka”
- “/edit make an IAM policy that creates a user with read-only access to S3”
- “/edit use this schema to write me a SQL query that gets recently churned users”

## Getting Started

You can try out Continue for free using a proxy server that securely makes calls with our API key to models like GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and Phind CodeLlama via OpenAI, Google, and Together respectively.

Once you're ready to use your own API key or a different model / provider, press the `+` button in the bottom left to add a new model to your `config.json`. Learn more about the models and providers [here](https://continue.dev/docs/model-setup/overview).
