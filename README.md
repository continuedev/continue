## Task, not tab, auto-complete

### Answer coding questions

Highlight sections of code and ask Continue for another perspective

- “how can I set up a Prisma schema that cascades deletes?”
- “where in the page should I be making this request to the backend?”
- “how can I communicate between these iframes?”

### Edit in natural language

Highlight a section of code and instruct Continue to refactor it

- “/edit migrate this digital ocean terraform file into one that works for GCP”
- “/edit change this plot into a bar chart in this dashboard component”
- “/edit rewrite this function to be async”

### Generate files from scratch

Open a blank file and let Continue start new Python scripts, React components, etc.

- “/edit here is a connector for postgres, now write one for kafka”
- “/edit make an IAM policy that creates a user with read-only access to S3”
- “/edit use this schema to write me a SQL query that gets recently churned users”

## Getting Started

### [Download for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)

By default, Continue uses `GPT-4` and `GPT-3.5-turbo` via the OpenAI API. 

You can adjust the config to use different LLMs, including local, private models. Read more [here](https://continue.dev/docs/customization#change-the-default-llm).
