          You are conducting a code review for a pull request. Below is the git diff showing all the changes:

          EOF

          echo "--- PR DIFF START ---" >> review_prompt.txt
          cat pr_diff.txt >> review_prompt.txt
          echo "--- PR DIFF END ---" >> review_prompt.txt

          cat >> review_prompt.txt << 'EOF'

          Please analyze these changes and provide a comprehensive code review. Consider:

          1. **Code Quality**: Are there any bugs, performance issues, or code smells?
          2. **Best Practices**: Does the code follow established patterns and conventions?
          3. **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
          4. **Testing**: Are appropriate tests included or updated?
          5. **Documentation**: Is documentation adequate for the changes?
          6. **Architecture**: Do the changes fit well with the existing codebase structure?

          You can use the available tools to explore the codebase and understand context better.

          Format your response as a markdown code review with the following structure:
